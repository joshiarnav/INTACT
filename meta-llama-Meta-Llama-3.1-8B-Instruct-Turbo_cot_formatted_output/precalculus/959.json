This vector will be used to determine the direction of the line.\n\nThe direction vector can be found by subtracting the coordinates of the two points:\n\nDirection Vector = (5 - 3, 1 - 4, 6 - 1) = (2, -3, 5)\n\n2. **Write the parametric equations** of the line. We can use the point (3, 4, 1) and the direction vector to write the parametric equations of the line.\n\nThe parametric equations of the line can be written as:\n\nx = 3 + 2t\ny = 4 - 3t\nz = 1 + 5t\n\nwhere t is a parameter.\n\n3. **Determine the value of t when the line intersects the xy-plane**. The xy-plane is defined by z = 0.\n\nWe can set z = 0 in the parametric equations of the line and solve for t:\n\n0 = 1 + 5t\n5t = -1\nt = -1/5\n\n4. **Find the coordinates** of the point where the line intersects the xy-plane.\n\nSubstitute t = -1/5 into the parametric equations of the line:\n\nx = 3 + 2(-1/5) = 3 - 2/5 = (15 - 2)/5 = 13/5\ny = 4 - 3(-1/5) = 4 + 3/5 = (20 + 3)/5 = 23/5\nz = 1 + 5(-1/5) = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nTherefore, the point where the line intersects the xy-plane is:\n\n$\\boxed{(13/5, 23/5, 0)}$"
