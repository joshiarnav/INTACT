    "problem": "Find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the product $(ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4)$.",
    "solution": "We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$. Thus, $$(3x^2) \\times (-4) + (-2x) \\times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the product, we'll need to multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second polynomial and then combine like terms.\n\nThe first polynomial is: $ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x$\nThe second polynomial is: $bx^2 - 7x - 4$\n\nWe'll multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second polynomial:\n\n1. $ax^3$ multiplied by $bx^2$: $abx^5$\n2. $ax^3$ multiplied by $-7x$: $-7ax^4$\n3. $ax^3$ multiplied by $-4$: $-4ax^3$\n4. $3x^2$ multiplied by $bx^2$: $3bx^4$\n5. $3x^2$ multiplied by $-7x$: $-21x^3$\n6. $3x^2$ multiplied by $-4$: $-12x^2$\n7. $-2x$ multiplied by $bx^2$: $-2bx^3$\n8. $-2x$ multiplied by $-7x$: $14x^2$\n9. $-2x$ multiplied by $-4$: $8x$\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n- For the $x^5$ term: $abx^5$\n- For the $x^4$ term: $-7ax^4 + 3bx^4$\n- For the $x^3$ term: $-4ax^3 - 21x^3 - 2bx^3$\n- For the $x^2$ term: $-12x^2 + 14x^2$\n- For the $x^1$ term: $8x$\n\nCombining like terms for the $x^2$ term:\n-12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2\n\nSo, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the product is 2."
