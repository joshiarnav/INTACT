    "model_solution": "To find $f(g(5))$, we'll follow the order of operations, step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find $g(5)$. To do this, we substitute $5$ into the function $g(x)=2x-1$:\n\n$g(5) = 2(5) - 1$\n$g(5) = 10 - 1$\n$g(5) = 9$\n\nNow that we have $g(5) = 9$, we can substitute this into the function $f(x)=x^2+1$ to find $f(g(5))$:\n\n$f(g(5)) = f(9)$\n$f(g(5)) = 9^2 + 1$\n$f(g(5)) = 81 + 1$\n$f(g(5)) = 82$\n\nTherefore, $f(g(5)) = 82$."
