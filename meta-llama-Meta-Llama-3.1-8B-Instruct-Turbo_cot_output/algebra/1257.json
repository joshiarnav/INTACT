    "problem": "Given that $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$, what is the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$?",
    "solution": "We are looking at the range of $f(x)$ when $x$ is in the interval $[1,\\infty)$. Because $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0, but never reaches it.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 inclusive, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the function**: $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$. This is a function where the exponent is negative, meaning it is a reciprocal function.\n\n2. **Determine the behavior of the function**: Since $k < 0$, as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ decreases. In other words, the function is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$.\n\n3. **Find the value of the function at the lower bound of the interval**: The lower bound of the interval is $x = 1$. Plugging in $x = 1$ into the function, we get:\n\\[ f(1) = 1^k \\]\nSince $1$ raised to any power is $1$, we have:\n\\[ f(1) = 1 \\]\n\n4. **Determine the behavior of the function as $x$ approaches infinity**: As $x$ approaches infinity, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches $0$. This is because a negative exponent causes the function to approach $0$ as the base increases.\n\n5. **Determine the range of the function**: Based on the behavior of the function, we know that it is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We also know that the function starts at $1$ and approaches $0$ as $x$ approaches infinity. Therefore, the range of the function is the set of all values between $0$ (exclusive) and $1$ (inclusive).\n\nIn interval notation, the range of the function is $(0, 1]$."
