    "problem": "Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. \n   Let's denote the distance of the first day as D1 and the second day as D2. \n   We have the equation: D1 + D2 = 22.\n\n2. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. \n   The average of the second and third days is 13, so the total distance for these two days is 13 * 2 = 26.\n   Let's denote the distance of the third day as D3. \n   We have the equation: D2 + D3 = 26.\n\n3. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. \n   Let's denote the distance of the last day as D4. \n   We have the equation: D3 + D4 = 30.\n\n4. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. \n   Let's denote the distance of the first day as D1. \n   We have the equation: D1 + D3 = 26.\n\nNow we have four equations:\n\n1. D1 + D2 = 22\n2. D2 + D3 = 26\n3. D3 + D4 = 30\n4. D1 + D3 = 26\n\nWe can solve these equations together. First, let's get D2 in terms of D1 from the first equation:\n\nD2 = 22 - D1\n\nNow, substitute this expression for D2 into the second equation:\n\n(22 - D1) + D3 = 26\n22 - D1 + D3 = 26\nD1 - D3 = -4\n\nNow we have:\n\nD1 + D3 = 26  (equation 4)\nD1 - D3 = -4  (new equation)\n\nWe can add these two equations to get:\n\n2D1 = 22\nD1 = 11\n\nNow substitute D1 = 11 into equation 4:\n\n11 + D3 = 26\nD3 = 15\n\nNow, substitute D3 = 15 into equation 3:\n\nD3 + D4 = 30\n15 + D4 = 30\nD4 = 15\n\nNow, substitute D2 = 22 - D1 = 22 - 11 = 11 and D3 = 15 into equation 2:\n\nD2 + D3 = 26\n11 + 15 = 26\n26 = 26 (this equation is true)\n\nNow we have all the distances for each day:\nD1 = 11\nD2 = 11\nD3 = 15\nD4 = 15\n\nNow we can calculate the total distance of the trail:\nTotal distance = D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52\n\nThe total hike for the Rocky Path Trail was 52 miles."
