    "problem": "If $27^8=9^q$, what is $q$?",
    "solution": "We begin by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the base 2: $(3^3)^8=(3^2)^q$, which simplifies to $3^{24}=3^{2q}$. Setting the exponents equal to each other, $24=2q$, or $q=\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "We can rewrite $27^8$ and $9^q$ in terms of their prime factors to make the equation easier to work with. \n\nSince $27 = 3^3$ and $9 = 3^2$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$(3^3)^8 = (3^2)^q$\n\nUsing the property of exponents $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, we can simplify the left side of the equation to:\n\n$3^{24} = 3^{2q}$\n\nNow we have the same base on both sides, so we can equate the exponents:\n\n$24 = 2q$\n\nTo find $q$, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n$q = 24/2$\n$q = 12$\n\nSo, the value of $q$ is 12."
