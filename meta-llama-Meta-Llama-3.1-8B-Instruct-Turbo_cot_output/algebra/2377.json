    "problem": "What is the smallest positive value of $m$ so that the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions?",
    "solution": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the solutions the the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$. We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively, so $p+q = m/10$ and $pq = 420/10 = 42$. Since $m = 10(p+q)$, we minimize $m$ by minimizing the sum $p+q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are integers and multiply to 42, the possible values of $(p,q)$ are $(1,42),(2,21),(3,14),(6,7),(7,6),(14,3),(21,2),(42,1)$. (Note that if $p$ and $q$ are both negative, then $p+q$ is negative, so $m$ would be negative, which is excluded by the problem.) The sum $p+q$ is minimized when $(p,q) = (6,7)$ or $(7,6)$. In either case, $m = 10(p+q) = 10(6+7) = \\boxed{130}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive value of $m$ for which the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions, we can use the quadratic formula and the concept of discriminant.\n\nThe quadratic formula for solving the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nFor the given equation, $a = 10$, $b = -m$, and $c = 420$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{m \\pm \\sqrt{(-m)^2 - 4(10)(420)}}{2(10)}$\n$x = \\frac{m \\pm \\sqrt{m^2 - 16800}}{20}$\n\nSince we want the solutions to be integral, the discriminant ($m^2 - 16800$) must be a perfect square.\n\nLet's denote the perfect square as $k^2$. Then:\n\n$m^2 - 16800 = k^2$\n$m^2 - k^2 = 16800$\n\nWe can factor the left-hand side as a difference of squares:\n\n$(m + k)(m - k) = 16800$\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive value of $m$ for which this equation holds. To do this, we need to find two factors of $16800$ that have the smallest difference.\n\nWe can find the prime factorization of $16800$:\n\n$16800 = 2^6 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$\n\nUsing this factorization, we can find the two factors of $16800$ with the smallest difference:\n\n$16800 = 100 \\cdot 168$\n\nNow, we can set up two equations using these factors:\n\n$m + k = 100$\n$m - k = 168$\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\n$m = \\frac{100 + 168}{2} = 134$\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive value of $m$ for which the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions is $134$."
