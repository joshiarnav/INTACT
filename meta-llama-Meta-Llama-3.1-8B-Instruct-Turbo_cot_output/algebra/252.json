    "problem": "The integers $G$ and $H$ are chosen such that\n\\[\\frac{G}{x+5}+\\frac{H}{x^2-4x}=\\frac{x^2-2x+10}{x^3+x^2-20x}\\]for all real values of $x$ except $-5$, $0$, and $4$. Find $H/G$.",
    "solution": "First, we factor the denominators, to get \\[\\frac{G}{x + 5} + \\frac{H}{x(x - 4)} = \\frac{x^2 - 2x + 10}{x(x + 5)(x - 4)}.\\]We then multiply both sides by $x(x + 5)(x - 4)$, to get \\[Gx(x - 4) + H(x + 5) = x^2 - 2x + 10.\\]We can solve for $G$ and $H$ by substituting suitable values of $x$.  For example, setting $x = -5$, we get $45G = 45$, so $G = 1$.  Setting $x = 0$, we get $5H = 10$, so $H = 2$.  (This may not seem legitimate, because we are told that the given equation holds for all $x$ except $-5$, 0, and 4.  This tells us that the equation $Gx(x - 4) + H(x + 5) = x^2 - 2x + 10$ holds for all $x$, except possibly $-5$, 0, and 4.  However, both sides of this equation are polynomials, and if two polynomials are equal for an infinite number of values of $x$, then the two polynomials are equal for all values of $x$.  Hence, we can substitute any value we wish to into this equation.)\n\nTherefore, $H/G = 2/1 = \\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the values of $G$ and $H$, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator, which is $(x+5)(x^2-4x)$.\n\nThis will get rid of the fractions and make it easier to work with the equation.\n\n\\[(x+5)(x^2-4x) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{G}{x+5}+\\frac{H}{x^2-4x}\\right)=\\left(x^2-2x+10\\right)\\]\n\n\\[(x^2-4x)(G) + (x+5)(H) = x^2-2x+10\\]\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation gives us:\n\n\\[Gx^2-4Gx+Hx+5H = x^2-2x+10\\]\n\nNow, we can compare the coefficients of each term on both sides of the equation. \n\nThe coefficient of $x^2$ on the left side is $G$, and the coefficient of $x^2$ on the right side is $1$. This gives us the equation:\n\n\\[G = 1\\]\n\nThe coefficient of $x$ on the left side is $-4G+H$, and the coefficient of $x$ on the right side is $-2$. This gives us the equation:\n\n\\[-4G+H = -2\\]\n\nWe already know that $G=1$, so we can substitute this value into the second equation to solve for $H$:\n\n\\[-4(1)+H = -2\\]\n\n\\[-4+H = -2\\]\n\n\\[H = 2\\]\n\nNow we have the values of $G$ and $H$, so we can find the value of $H/G$.\n\n\\[H/G = 2/1 = 2\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $H/G$ is $2$."
