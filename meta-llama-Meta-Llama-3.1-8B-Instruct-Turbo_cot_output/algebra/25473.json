    "problem": "Joann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for three and a half hours. If her friend, Fran, rides for 3 hours, at what average speed, in miles per hour, would she have to ride her bike to travel the same distance that Joann traveled?",
    "solution": "In $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, Joann covers $\\left(3\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ hours}\\right)(12\\text{ mph})=42$ miles.  If Fran's average speed in miles per hour is $s$, then Fran covers $3s$ miles in $3$ hours.  Solving $3s=42$ we find $s=\\boxed{14}$ miles per hour.",

    "model_solution": "To find the distance Joann traveled, we need to multiply her average speed (12 miles per hour) by the time she spent riding (3.5 hours). \n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nDistance = 12 \u00d7 3.5\nDistance = 42 miles\n\nNow, we know Fran needs to travel 42 miles in 3 hours to match Joann's distance. To find Fran's average speed, we'll divide the distance (42 miles) by the time (3 hours).\n\nAverage Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time\nAverage Speed = 42 miles \u00f7 3 hours\nAverage Speed = 14 miles per hour\n\nSo, Fran would need to ride her bike at an average speed of 14 miles per hour to travel the same distance as Joann in 3 hours."
