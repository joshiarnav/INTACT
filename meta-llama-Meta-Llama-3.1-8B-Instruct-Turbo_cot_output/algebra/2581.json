    "problem": "If $a$ is a constant such that $4x^2 + 14x + a$ is the square of a binomial, then what is $a$?",
    "solution": "If $4x^2 + 14x + a$  is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $2x +b$ for some number $b$, because $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$.  So, we compare $(2x+b)^2$ to $4x^2 + 14x + a$. Expanding $(2x+b)^2$ gives \\[(2x+b)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(b) + b^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.\\] Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $4x^2+14x+a$, we have $4bx=14x$, so $b=\\frac{14}{4}=\\frac{7}{2}$. Squaring the binomial gives $\\left(2x+\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2=4x^2+14x+\\frac{49}{4}$. Therefore, $a=\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $a$, we need to express $4x^2 + 14x + a$ as the square of a binomial. \n\nA binomial is an expression of the form $x + b$. The square of a binomial is given by the formula: \n\n$(x + b)^2 = x^2 + 2bx + b^2$\n\nWe need to find a binomial whose square matches the given expression $4x^2 + 14x + a$. \n\nFirst, let's factor out the coefficient of $x^2$ from the given expression, which is $4$. \n\nWe get: $4(x^2 + \\frac{14}{4}x + \\frac{a}{4})$\n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n$4(x^2 + \\frac{7}{2}x + \\frac{a}{4})$\n\nWe know that the square of a binomial is of the form $(x + b)^2 = x^2 + 2bx + b^2$. Comparing this with our expression $4(x^2 + \\frac{7}{2}x + \\frac{a}{4})$, we can see that $2b = \\frac{7}{2}$.\n\nSolving for $b$, we get: \n\n$b = \\frac{7}{4}$\n\nNow that we have found $b$, we can find $b^2$, which is equal to $\\frac{a}{4}$.\n\nWe get: \n\n$\\frac{a}{4} = (\\frac{7}{4})^2$\n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n$\\frac{a}{4} = \\frac{49}{16}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $4$, we get: \n\n$a = 4 \\times \\frac{49}{16}$\n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n$a = \\frac{49}{4}$\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\frac{49}{4}$."
