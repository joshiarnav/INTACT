    "problem": "What is the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime?",
    "solution": "We can factor the quadratic $6x^2-47x+15$ as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$. So we have $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(2x-15)(3x-1)|=|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|$. In order for $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself. Thus one of $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$.\n\nIf $|3x-1|=1$, then $3x-1=1$ or $3x-1=-1$. These equations yield $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $x=0$, respectively. We throw out $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ since it is not an integer, and keep $x=0$ as a candidate.\n\nIf $|2x-15|=1$, then $2x-15=1$, in which case $2x=16$ and $x=8$, or $2x-15=-1$, in which case $2x=14$ and $x=7$.\n\nThus our candidates for the greatest $x$ are $0, 7$, and $8$. It remains to check whether the other factor is prime. We first check $x=8$. Since $|2x-15|=1$, we know $|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|=|3x-1|=|24-1|=23$, which is prime. Thus $\\boxed{8}$ is the largest integer for which $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime, we need to factorize the given quadratic equation.\n\nFirst, let's factorize $6x^2-47x+15$. \n\nWe can factorize it as follows:\n$6x^2-47x+15 = (3x-15)(2x-1)$\n\nNow we have:\n$|6x^2-47x+15| = |(3x-15)(2x-1)|$\n\nFor $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its factors must be 1 and a prime number, or the number itself must be prime.\n\nLet's consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: When $x=1$, $|(3x-15)(2x-1)| = |(-12)(1)| = 12$, which is not prime.\n\nCase 2: When $x=2$, $|(3x-15)(2x-1)| = |(-9)(3)| = 27$, which is not prime.\n\nCase 3: When $x=5$, $|(3x-15)(2x-1)| = |(0)(9)| = 0$, which is not prime.\n\nCase 4: When $x=8$, $|(3x-15)(2x-1)| = |(9)(15)| = 135$, which is not prime.\n\nCase 5: When $x=15/3$, $|(3x-15)(2x-1)| = |(0)(1)| = 0$, which is not prime.\n\nCase 6: When $x=1/2$, $|(3x-15)(2x-1)| = |(-29)(1)| = 29$, which is prime.\n\nCase 7: When $x=15/6$, $|(3x-15)(2x-1)| = |(0)(-1/2)| = 0$, which is not prime.\n\nNow let's consider another factor of (6x^2-47x+15) as 6x^2-47x+15 = 3(2x^2-17x+5).\n\nFor $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its factors must be 1 and a prime number. If we divide $3(2x^2-17x+5)$ by 3, we will get $2x^2-17x+5$. The remaining cases for the factor 2x^2-17x+5 when divided by (x-1) and (2x-1) are to be considered the same as before, except for the divisor. The other factor is 3(x-1)(2x-1) or 3(x-1)(x-5/2).\n\nFor the remaining cases of the factor 3(x-1)(2x-1) or 3(x-1)(x-5/2), we can see the same result as before, except for the divisor. \n\nCase 8: When $x=1/2$, $|(3x-15)(2x-1)| = |(-29)(1)| = 29$, which is prime.\n\nCase 9: When $x=4/3$, $|(3x-15)(2x-1)| = |(-11)(2/3)| = 22/3$, which is not prime.\n\nCase 10: When $x=5$, $|(3x-15)(2x-1)| = |(0)(9)| = 0$, which is not prime.\n\nCase 11: When $x=8$, $|(3x-15)(2x-1)| = |(9)(15)| = 135$, which is not prime.\n\nSince the greatest value of x in the previous cases is 8 for 6x^2-47x+15 = (3x-15)(2x-1) and for the other factor (x-1)(2x-1) or (x-5/2)(2x-1), the greatest value of x is 8.\n\nCase 12: When $x=8$, $|3(2x^2-17x+5)| = |3(2(8)^2-17(8)+5)| = |3(128-136+5)| = |3(0)| = 0$, which is not prime.\n\nCase 13: When $x=1/2$, $|3(2x^2-17x+5)| = |3(2(1/2)^2-17(1/2)+5)| = |3(1/4-17/2+5)| = |3(1/4-34/2+20/2)| = |3(-33/4)| = |(-99/4)|$, which is not prime.\n\nCase 14: When $x=1$, $|3(2x^2-17x+5)| = |3(2(1)^2-17(1)+5)| = |3(2-17+5)| = |3(-10)| = 30$, which is not prime.\n\nCase 15: When $x=5/2$, $|3(2x^2-17x+5)| = |3(2(5/2)^2-17(5/2)+5)| = |3(25/4-85/2+5)| = |3(25/4-85/2+20/2)| = |3(25/4-65/2)| = |3(25/4-130/4)| = |3(-105/4)| = |(-315/4)|$, which is not prime.\n\nCase 16: When $x=5$, $|3(2x^2-17x+5)| = |3(2(5)^2-17(5)+5)| = |3(50-85+5)| = |3(-30)| = 90$, which is not prime.\n\nNow let's consider another case for $2x^2-17x+5$. \n\nFor $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its factors must be 1 and a prime number. If we divide $2x^2-17x+5$ by (x-1) and (x-5/2), we will get 2.\n\nSince 2 is a prime number, we can say that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime when $x=1$ and $x=5/2$.\n\nHowever, we need to check whether $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime when $x=1$ and $x=5/2$.\n\nWhen $x=1$, $|6x^2-47x+15| = |6(1)^2-47(1)+15| = |6-47+15| = |-26| = 26$, which is not prime.\n\nWhen $x=5/2$, $|6x^2-47x+15| = |6(5/2)^2-47(5/2)+15| = |(75/2)-117.5+15| = |(75/2)-102.5| = |(-29/2)| = 14.5$, which is not prime.\n\nSince we need to find the greatest integer x such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime, we can say that the greatest integer is 5/2, but 5/2 is not an integer.\n\nNow let's consider another factor of $6x^2-47x+15$ as 6x^2-47x+15 = 3(2x^2-17x+5) = 3(x-1)(2x-1) or 3(x-1)(x-5/2).\n\nFor $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its factors must be 1 and a prime number. If we divide $3(x-1)(2x-1)$ or $3(x-1)(x-5/2)$ by 3, we will get $x-1$ or $x-5/2$. The remaining cases for the factor $x-1$ or $x-5/2$ when divided by 2x-1 or $2x-1$ and (x-1) or (x-1) are to be considered the same as before, except for the divisor.  \n\nSince the greatest value of x in the previous cases is 8 for $3(x-1)(2x-1)$ or $3(x-1)(x-5/2)$ the greatest value of x is 8.\n\nHowever, we need to check whether $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime when $x=8$.\n\nWhen $x=8$, $|6x^2-47x+15| = |6(8)^2-47(8)+15| = |384-376+15| = |23| = 23$, which is prime.\n\nSince we need to find the greatest integer x such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime, we can say that the greatest integer is 8."
