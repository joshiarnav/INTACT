    "solution": "Looking at the graph, we can see the line intersects the y-axis at y=1.  This is the y-intercept, which is equal to the value of $b$.  Now, we need to find the slope of the line.  Looking carefully, we can see that for every one unit to the right the line travels, it goes up by two units.  For example, starting from the y-intercept at $(0,1)$, the line passes through a lattice point one unit over and two units up from there, at $(1,3)$.  The rise over run is then $\\frac{2}{1}$, so the slope is 2.  The equation of this line is $y=2x+1$.  Therefore, $mb=2(1)=\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the equation of the line in the form $y=mx+b$, we need to find the slope ($m$) and the y-intercept ($b$).\n\nStep 1: To find the slope ($m$), we need two points on the line. Let's find two points on the line.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that the line passes through the points (-3, -5) and (2, 5).\n\nStep 2: Now, we can use the formula for slope: \n\n\\[ m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\]\n\nwhere $(x_1, y_1)$ is (-3, -5) and $(x_2, y_2)$ is (2, 5).\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{5 - (-5)}{2 - (-3)} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the slope of the line is 2.\n\nStep 3: Now that we have the slope, we can find the y-intercept ($b$). We know that the line passes through the point (0, b). We can substitute these values into the equation of the line:\n\n\\[ y = mx + b \\]\n\\[ b = 2(0) + b \\]\n\\[ b = 0 + b \\]\nHowever, we can't find b this way since this equation will always equal b which is exactly what we are trying to solve for. To find b we should use the other point. Let's substitute the point (2, 5) into the equation of the line.\n\n\\[ 5 = 2(2) + b \\]\n\\[ 5 = 4 + b \\]\n\\[ 5 - 4 = b \\]\n\\[ 1 = b \\]\n\nSo, the y-intercept is 1.\n\nStep 4: Now that we have the slope and y-intercept, we can find $mb$.\n\n\\[ mb ma\u00e7(m)(b) \\]\n\\[ mb = 2(1) \\]\n\\[ mb = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $mb$ is 2."
