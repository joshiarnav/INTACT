    "problem": "Suppose $x$ and $y$ are integers such that  $xy+5x+4y=-5$.  Find the greatest possible value of $y$.",
    "solution": "Note that $(x+4)(y+5)$ equals $xy+5x+4y+20$.  So, add $20$ to both sides of the original equation to get $xy+5x+4y+20=15$, so now we may apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and write the equation as $(x+4)(y+5)=15$.\n\nThen, the potential ordered pairs $((x+4),(y+5))$ with $x<y$ are $(-15,-1)$, $(-5,-3)$, $(1,15)$ and $(3,5)$, since these are the pairs of integers that multiply to 15.  The greatest value for $y+5$ is thus $15$.  We solve $y+5=15$ for $y$ to yield $y=\\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's start by rearranging the given equation $xy+5x+4y=-5$.\n\nWe can apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to factorize the equation. This trick involves adding a constant to both sides of the equation to make it factorable.\n\nThe given equation can be rewritten as:\n$xy + 5x + 4y + 20 = -5 + 20$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$xy + 5x + 4y + 20 = 15$\n\nNow, we can factorize the equation as:\n$(x + 4)(y + 5) = 15$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, the factors of 15 will determine the possible values of $(x + 4)$ and $(y + 5)$. The pairs of factors of 15 are:\n\n1. (1, 15)\n2. (-1, -15)\n3. (3, 5)\n4. (-3, -5)\n\nNow, let's consider each pair of factors:\n\n1. (1, 15): $x + 4 = 1$ and $y + 5 = 15$\n   $x = -3$ and $y = 10$\n\n2. (-1, -15): $x + 4 = -1$ and $y + 5 = -15$\n   $x = -5$ and $y = -20$\n\n3. (3, 5): $x + 4 = 3$ and $y + 5 = 5$\n   $x = -1$ and $y = 0$\n\n4. (-3, -5): $x + 4 = -3$ and $y + 5 = -5$\n   $x = -7$ and $y = -10$\n\nWe want to find the greatest possible value of $y$. Therefore, the maximum value of $y$ is $y = 10$."
