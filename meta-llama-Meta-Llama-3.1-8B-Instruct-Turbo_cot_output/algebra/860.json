    "problem": "The equation $x^2+ ax = -14$ has only integer solutions for $x$. If $a$ is a positive integer, what is the greatest possible value of $a$?",
    "solution": "The left-hand side factors into $x(x+a)=-14$, so $x$ and $x+a$ both divide $-14$. One of the two factors is negative and the other positive, since their product is negative. $x+a>x$, so $x+a>0$ and $x<0$. This leaves 4 possibilities for $x$, since it is negative and divides $-14$ evenly: $-1$, $-2$, $-7$, and $-14$. $x=-1$ gives $x+a=14$ and therefore $a=15$. Similarly, $x=-2$, $x=-7$, and $x=-14$ give $a=9$, $a=9$, and $a=15$, respectively. The largest value for $a$ is thus $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's factor the equation $x^2 + ax = -14$.\n\nSince $x$ has only integer solutions, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$x^2 + ax + 14 = 0$\n\nWe can factor this quadratic equation by finding two numbers whose product is $14$ and whose sum is $a$.\n\nThe factors of $14$ are: $(1, 14)$, $(2, 7)$, $(-1, -14)$, and $(-2, -7)$.\n\nNow, let's check each pair to see if their sum is a positive integer:\n\n- $(1, 14)$: $1 + 14 = 15$ (valid)\n- $(2, 7)$: $2 + 7 = 9$ (valid)\n- $(-1, -14)$: $-1 + (-14) = -15$ (not valid, since $a$ is positive)\n- $(-2, -7)$: $-2 + (-7) = -9$ (not valid, since $a$ is positive)\n\nSo, the possible values of $a$ are $15$ and $9$.\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of $a$, we choose the larger of the two values. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $a$ is $15$."
