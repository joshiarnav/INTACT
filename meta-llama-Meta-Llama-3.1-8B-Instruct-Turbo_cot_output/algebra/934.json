    "problem": "The graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertex $(-4,0)$ which passes through the point $(1,-75)$.  What is the value of $a$?",
    "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve for the value of $a$ in the quadratic equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, we'll use the given information about the vertex and the point it passes through.\n\nStep 1: The vertex of a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by the point $(-\\frac{b}{2a}, c)$. Since we are given that the vertex of the parabola is $(-4, 0)$, we can write the following equations:\n\n$-\\frac{b}{2a} = -4$\n$c = 0$\n\nStep 2: We can rewrite the first equation as $b = 8a$.\n\nStep 3: Plugging $b = 8a$ into the quadratic equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ gives us $y = ax^2 + 8ax$.\n\nStep 4: Because we know the vertex is $(-4, 0)$, we can write the equation in the form $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$ where $(h, k)$ is the vertex. So we can write the equation as $y = a(x + 4)^2$.\n\nStep 5: Since the point $(1, -75)$ is on the parabola, we can substitute it into the equation: $-75 = a(1 + 4)^2$.\n\nStep 6: Simplifying the equation gives us $-75 = a(5)^2$.\n\nStep 7: Simplifying further gives us $-75 = a(25)$.\n\nStep 8: Dividing both sides by 25 gives us $a = \\frac{-75}{25}$.\n\nStep 9: Simplifying the fraction gives us $a = -3$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $-3$."
