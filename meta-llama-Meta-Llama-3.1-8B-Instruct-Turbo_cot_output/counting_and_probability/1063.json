    "problem": "How many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once?",
    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of distinct sequences of four letters that meet the given conditions, we can break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: The first letter must be 'L', so there is only 1 choice for the first letter.\n\nStep 2: The last letter must be 'Q', so there is only 1 choice for the last letter.\n\nStep 3: We are left with the letters 'E', 'A', 'U', and 'S'. Since no letter can appear in a sequence more than once, we need to choose 2 letters from these 4 for the second and third positions.\n\nThere are 4 ways to choose the second letter (any of the 4 remaining letters), and for each of these choices, there are 3 ways to choose the third letter (since we cannot repeat the letter already chosen for the second position).\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose the second and third letters is 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nHowever, this counts each sequence twice (once for each order of the second and third letters), so we need to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct sequences is 1 * 12 / 2 = 6 * 1."
