    "solution": "It is clear that the maximal positive difference is $6 - 1 = 5$. Moreover, we can use 6 to ensure that we can get all positive integer differences up to 5: $6 - 5 = 1$, $6 - 4 = 2$, $6 - 3 = 3$, $6 - 2 = 4$, $6 - 1 = 5$. So, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possible differences.",

    "model_solution": "To find the different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, we need to find all possible differences between the elements in the set.\n\nThe set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\}$. \n\nThe positive differences between the elements can be found by subtracting each element from every other element, excluding any duplicates. For example, the differences from 1 are $|2-1| = 1$, $|3-1| = 2$, $|4-1| = 3$, $|5-1| = 4$, and $|6-1| = 5$. \n\nWe repeat this process for each element in the set and eliminate any duplicates.\n\n1. From 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n2. From 2: 1, 2, 3, 4\n3. From 3: 1, 2, 3\n4. From 4: 1, 2, 3\n5. From 5: 1, 2\n6. From 6: 1, 2\n\nNow, we eliminate any duplicates from the list. The remaining positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. \n\nTherefore, the total number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\}$ is 5."
