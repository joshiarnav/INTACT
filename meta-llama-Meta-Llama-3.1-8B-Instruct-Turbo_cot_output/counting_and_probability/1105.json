    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people be seated in a row of chairs if three of the people, John, Wilma, and Paul, refuse to sit in three consecutive seats?",
    "solution": "The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$. The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 3!$. We can arrive at $6!\\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul.  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $$8!-6!\\times 3!=8\\times 7\\times 6! - 6!\\times 3! = (8\\times 7 - 3!)6! = (50)(720)=\\boxed{36000}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.\n\n**Step 1: Total number of ways to seat 8 people in a row**\nThe total number of ways to arrange 8 people in a row is given by 8! (8 factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to 8.\n\n8! = 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 40,320\n\n**Step 2: Number of ways to seat 8 people with John, Wilma, and Paul together**\nNow, let's consider the case where John, Wilma, and Paul sit together in three consecutive seats. We can treat them as a single block (or group) of 3 people. This block can be arranged in 6! ways (since there are 6 people left to arrange).\n\nWithin this block, John, Wilma, and Paul can be arranged in 3! ways.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to seat 8 people with John, Wilma, and Paul together is:\n\n6! \u00d7 3! = (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 720 \u00d7 6 = 4,320\n\n**Step 3: Number of ways to seat 8 people with John, Wilma, and Paul not together**\nTo find the number of arrangements where John, Wilma, and Paul do not sit in three consecutive seats, we subtract the number of arrangements where they are together from the total number of arrangements.\n\nNumber of ways to seat 8 people with John, Wilma, and Paul not together:\n40,320 - 4,320 = 36,000\n\nTherefore, there are 36,000 ways to seat 8 people in a row if John, Wilma, and Paul refuse to sit in three consecutive seats."
