    "problem": "What is the sum of all integer values $n$ for which $\\binom{20}{n}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$?",
    "solution": "From Pascal's identity $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\binom{20}{11}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$, so $n=11$.\n\nWe know that $\\binom{21}{11}=\\binom{21}{21-11}=\\binom{21}{10}$.\n\nWe use Pascal's identity again to get $\\binom{20}{9}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{10}$, so $n=9$.\n\nThere are two values for $n$, $9$ and $11$, so the sum is $9+11=\\boxed{20}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nWe are given the equation:\n$\\binom{20}{n}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$\n\nThe first thing to notice is that the left-hand side has two terms, but the right-hand side only has one term. However, we can expand the right-hand side of the equation to see if it helps:\n$\\binom{21}{11} = \\binom{20}{11} + \\binom{20}{10}$\n\nNow, let's rewrite the equation:\n$\\binom{20}{n}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{20}{11} + \\binom{20}{10}$\n\nIt's clear that the $\\binom{20}{10}$ term is on both sides of the equation and cancels out:\n$\\binom{20}{n}=\\binom{20}{11}$\n\nSince the binomial coefficient is symmetric, we have:\n$\\binom{20}{n}=\\binom{20}{20-n}$\n\nSetting the two expressions equal to each other, we get:\n$\\binom{20}{n}=\\binom{20}{11}$\n\nThis implies that $n = 11$ or $n = 20-11 = 9$.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the sum of all integer values $n$ that satisfy the equation. Therefore, the sum of all integer values $n$ is $9 + 11 = 20$.\n\nThe answer is $20$."
