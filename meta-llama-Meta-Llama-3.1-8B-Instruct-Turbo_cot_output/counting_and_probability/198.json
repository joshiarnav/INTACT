    "problem": "An unfair coin lands on heads with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the expected worth of a coin flip, we need to consider both the probability of getting heads and the probability of getting tails, along with the respective gains and losses.\n\nStep 1:  Identify the probabilities and gains/losses for each outcome.\n- Heads: $\\frac34$ (probability)\n- Tails: $\\frac14$ (probability)\n- Heads: $\\$3$ (gain)\n- Tails: $-\\$8$ (loss)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected worth for each outcome by multiplying the probability by the respective gain or loss.\n- Expected worth for heads: $\\frac34 \\times \\$3$\n- Expected worth for tails: $\\frac14 \\times -\\$8$\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected worth for each outcome.\n- Expected worth for heads: $\\frac34 \\times \\$3 = \\$2.25$\n- Expected worth for tails: $\\frac14 \\times -\\$8 = -\\$2.00$\n\nStep 4: Find the total expected worth by adding the expected worth for heads and tails.\n- Total expected worth: $\\$2.25 - \\$2.00 = \\$0.25$\n\nTherefore, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\$0.25$ when rounded to the nearest hundredth."
