    "problem": "The probability that Kim has a math test today is $\\frac{4}{7}$. What is the probability that Kim does not have a math test today? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that Kim does not have a math test is equal to one minus the probability she does have a math test. So, the probability of not having a math test is $1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that Kim does not have a math test today, we need to subtract the probability that Kim does have a math test from 1.\n\n1. The probability that Kim has a math test is $\\frac{4}{7}$.\n2. The total probability that something will happen or not happen is equal to 1.\n3. So, the probability that Kim does not have a math test is $1 - \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nTo subtract $\\frac{4}{7}$ from 1, we can rewrite 1 as $\\frac{7}{7}$. \n\nSo, $1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7-4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Kim does not have a math test today is $\\frac{3}{7}$."
