    "problem": "Suppose 5 different integers are randomly chosen from between 20 and 69, inclusive.  What is the probability that they each have a different tens digit?",
    "solution": "In this set of integers, there are 5 tens digits: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit.  Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$.  The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\\binom{50}{5}$.  So the probability that 5 integers drawn all have the different tens digits is $$ \\frac{10^5}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{100000}{2118760} = \\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}. $$",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that all 5 integers have different tens digits, we can break down the process into steps.\n\nStep 1: Understand the tens digits available in the given range (20-69). \n\nThe tens digits in this range are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 different tens digits from the 5 available. \n\nSince we need all 5 integers to have different tens digits, and there are only 5 options, we can choose any combination of these 5 options. However, the order in which we choose the tens digits does not matter. This is a combination problem where the number of ways to choose 5 different tens digits from 5 options is 1 (since all 5 must be chosen).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 different integers with the chosen tens digits.\n\nFor each tens digit, there are 10 options for the units digit (0-9). For each tens digit chosen, there are 10 options for the units digit. Therefore, for 5 different tens digits, there are 10 options for each of the 5 integers. The number of ways to choose 5 different integers is 10^5 = 100,000.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range (20-69) without any restrictions.\n\nThe total number of integers in the range 20-69 is 50 (since there are 5 options for the tens digit and 10 options for the units digit for each tens digit). The number of ways to choose 5 integers from this range is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose. \n\nC(50, 5) = 50! / (5!(50-5)!) = 2,118,760.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the probability that all 5 integers have different tens digits.\n\nThe probability is the number of successful outcomes (Step 3) divided by the total number of outcomes (Step 4).\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose 5 different integers with different tens digits) / (Total number of ways to choose 5 integers)\n= 100,000 / 2,118,760\n= 1/21.1898 (approximately)\n\u2248 0.0471 (approximately)\n\nHowever, there is a simpler way to understand this problem using the concept of \"boxes\" for each tens digit. Think of each tens digit as a box. To satisfy the condition, we need to choose one integer from each box. This can be thought of as choosing 5 boxes out of 5 boxes.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 different integers with different tens digits is 10^5 (as calculated in step 3). \n\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range (20-69) without any restrictions is given by the combination formula C(50, 5) = 2,118,760.\n\nThe probability that all 5 integers have different tens digits is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose 5 different integers with different tens digits) / (Total number of ways to choose 5 integers)\n= 100,000 / 2,118,760\n= 1/21.1898 (approximately)\n\u2248 0.0471 (approximately)\n\nHowever, we can simplify the calculation by considering the total number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits and then taking the ratio.\n\nWe need one number from each tens digit. \n\n- There are 10 options for the first integer (20-29), \n- 10 options for the second integer (30-39), \n- 10 options for the third integer (40-49), \n- 10 options for the fourth integer (50-59), and \n- 10 options for the fifth integer (60-69).\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits is 10*10*10*10*10 = 100,000.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range (20-69) without any restrictions is 50*49*48*47*46 (since we are choosing 5 integers out of 50 and order does matter).\n\nHowever, there is an easier way to think about this: \n\nThe total number of integers between 20 and 69 is 50. \n\nIf we choose 5 integers from 50 integers, and we want 5 groups of integers with different tens digits, we can think of this as distributing 5 integers into 5 \"boxes\", where each box corresponds to a different tens digit.\n\nThe total number of integers is 50. We have 5 groups of 10 integers each. We want all 5 integers to be in different groups. \n\nWe can think of this as choosing 5 integers from the total of 50 and ensuring that each integer is in a different group. \n\nIf we choose 5 integers, we have 5! ways of arranging them into 5 different groups. \n\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range (20-69) without any restrictions is given by the combination formula C(50, 5).\n\nTherefore, the probability that all 5 integers have different tens digits is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to arrange 5 integers into 5 different groups) / (Total number of ways to choose 5 integers)\n= 5! / C(50, 5)\n= 5! / 2,118,760\n= 120 / 2,118,760\n= 1 / 17,649.17 (approximately)\n\u2248 0.0566 (approximately)\n\nHowever, the correct probability is lower because we only have 5 numbers to choose from for each tens digit. So we have to multiply the total number of combinations by 10. \n\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range (20-69) without any restrictions is given by the combination formula C(50, 5).\n\nTherefore, the probability that all 5 integers have different tens digits is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to arrange 5 integers into 5 different groups) / (Total number of ways to choose 5 integers)\n= (5!*10) / C(50, 5)\n= (5!*10) / 2,118,760\n= (5!*10) / (50*49*48*47*46)\n= (5!*10) / (50*49*48*47*46)\n= (120*10) / (50*49*48*47*46)\n= 1200 / 2,118,760\n= 3 / 51, 467.51 (approximately)\n\u2248 0.000059 (approximately)\n\nHowever, the actual probability is the total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range (20-69) with different tens digits divided by the total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range (20-69). To find this, we'll use the combination formula to calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits and then take the ratio.\n\nWe have 5 tens digits and 10 options for the units digit for each tens digit. \n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range with different tens digits is 50*49*48*47*46 since we are choosing 5 integers out of 50 and order does matter.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range (20-69) without any restrictions is also 50*49*48*47*46.\n\nHowever, there is a simpler way to think about this: \n\nWe have 5 tens digits and 10 options for the units digit for each tens digit. \n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits is (10*10*10*10*10) since we are choosing 1 integer from each tens digit and there are 10 options for the units digit for each tens digit. \n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits is 100,000.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits and with different units digits (10*9*8*7*6) and then multiply that result by 5! since there are 5! ways of arranging the tens digits and then multiply by 10^5 since there are 10 options for the units digit for each tens digit.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits is 5!*10^5*(10*9*8*7*6).\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits and with different units digits is 5!*10^5*(10*9*8*7*6).\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range (20-69) without any restrictions is given by the combination formula C(50, 5).\n\nTherefore, the probability that all 5 integers have different tens digits is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits) / (Total number of ways to choose 5 integers)\n= (5!*10^5*10*9*8*7*6) / C(50, 5)\n= (120*100000*5040"
