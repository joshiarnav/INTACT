    "problem": "After a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",
    "solution": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of handshakes between gymnasts.\n\nLet's denote the total number of gymnasts as n. Since each gymnast shook hands with every other gymnast on every team (except herself), we can calculate the total number of handshakes as follows:\n\nTotal gymnast handshakes = (n * (n-1)) / 2\n\nHere's why we divide by 2: If gymnast A shakes hands with gymnast B, it counts as one handshake, not two. So, we divide the product of n and (n-1) by 2 to get the total number of handshakes.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of handshakes, including the coach.\n\nWe know that the total number of handshakes is 281. Let's denote the number of handshakes involving the coach as x.\n\nTotal handshakes = Total gymnast handshakes + x\n\nSubstituting the formula for Total gymnast handshakes, we get:\n\n281 = ((n * (n-1)) / 2) + x\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of x.\n\nTo do this, we need to find the largest possible value of n such that the total number of gymnast handshakes is less than or equal to 281.\n\nStep 3: Find the largest possible value of n.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(n * (n-1)) / 2 <= 281\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\nn * (n-1) <= 562\n\nWe can try different values of n to find the largest possible value.\n\nFor n = 24, we get:\n\n24 * (24-1) = 552\n\nFor n = 25, we get:\n\n25 * (25-1) = 600\n\nSince 552 is less than or equal to 562, and 600 is greater than 562, the largest possible value of n is 24.\n\nStep 4: Find the minimum value of x.\n\nNow that we have the largest possible value of n, we can find the minimum value of x.\n\nSubstituting n = 24 into the equation, we get:\n\n281 = ((24 * (24-1)) / 2) + x\n\n281 = (552 / 2) + x\n\n281 = 276 + x\n\nx = 281 - 276\n\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in is 5."
