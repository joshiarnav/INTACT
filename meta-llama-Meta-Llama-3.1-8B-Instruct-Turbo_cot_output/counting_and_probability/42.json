    "problem": "How many different positive, four-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9 and 9?",
    "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 4 distinct digits, there would be $4! = 24$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digit were different we would have twice as many orderings). So, our answer is $\\frac{4!}{2!\\cdot 2!} = 2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of digits**: We have 4 digits: 2, 2, 9, and 9.\n\n2. **Identify repeated digits**: We have two pairs of repeated digits: two 2s and two 9s.\n\n3. **Calculate permutations for distinct digits**: If all the digits were distinct, the number of permutations would be 4! (4 factorial), which equals 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24.\n\n4. **Adjust for repeated digits**: Since we have two pairs of repeated digits, we must divide the total number of permutations by the number of permutations of each pair. For the pair of 2s, there are 2! permutations, and for the pair of 9s, there are also 2! permutations. Therefore, we divide the total number of permutations by 2! \u00d7 2! = 4.\n\n5. **Calculate the final number of permutations**: 4! / (2! \u00d7 2!) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nHowever, there is another way to think about this problem:\n\n- If the digits were all distinct, there would be 4! (24) ways to arrange them.\n- Since we have two 2s and two 9s, we can fix one digit in each of the positions where there are two identical digits. This leaves us with 2 digits to arrange. There are 2! ways to arrange the remaining digits.\n\nHowever, this method does not take into account the fact that we can fix any two of the four digits in any two of the positions. This means we don't need to multiply the result by 2. \n\nSo, the final answer is 2!/2  (2! divided by 2) = 2/2 = 1  * (2!/2)  = ( 2!) /2 = 2."
