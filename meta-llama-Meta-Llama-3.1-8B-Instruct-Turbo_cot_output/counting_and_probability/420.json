    "problem": "In how many different ways can four students stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other?",
    "solution": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n**Step 1: Total number of ways without restrictions**\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways four students can stand in a straight line without any restrictions. There are 4 choices for the first position, 3 choices for the second position, 2 choices for the third position, and 1 choice for the fourth position. This can be calculated using the permutation formula:\n\n4! (4 factorial) = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 different ways four students can stand in a straight line without any restrictions.\n\n**Step 2: Number of ways the two students stand next to each other**\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways the two students who refuse to stand next to each other actually stand next to each other. We can treat these two students as a single unit, which we'll call \"A\". So, now we have three units: A (the two students together), and the other two students.\n\nThere are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange these three units in a straight line:\n\n3! = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6\n\nHowever, within the unit \"A\", the two students can switch places, so we need to multiply the number of arrangements by 2:\n\n6 \u00d7 2 = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 ways the two students can stand next to each other.\n\n**Step 3: Number of ways the two students do not stand next to each other**\n\nTo find the number of ways the two students do not stand next to each other, we subtract the number of ways they do stand next to each other from the total number of ways:\n\n24 (total ways) - 12 (ways they stand next to each other) = 12\n\nTherefore, there are 12 different ways four students can stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other."
