    "problem": "How many three digit numbers are left if we exclude all three digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent?",
    "solution": "The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits. There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B. Since there are $9\\cdot10\\cdot10=900$ total three digit numbers, and $9\\cdot9=81$ numbers which aren't valid, there are $900-81=\\boxed{819}$ valid numbers.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Total number of three-digit numbers: \nSince the first digit can be any number from 1 to 9 (cannot be 0), the second digit can be any number from 0 to 9, and the third digit can be any number from 0 to 9, the total number of three-digit numbers is 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.\n\n2. Number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same (but not adjacent):\nTo achieve this, we have two cases:\n\na) First and third digits are the same, and second digit is different.\n   - The first digit can be any number from 1 to 9, so there are 9 options.\n   - The second digit can be any number from 0 to 9, except the first digit, so there are 9 options.\n   - The third digit is the same as the first digit, so there is 1 option.\n   - Total number of combinations for this case: 9 * 9 * 1 = 81.\n\nb) First and second digits are the same, and third digit is different.\n   - The first digit can be any number from 1 to 9, so there are 9 options.\n   - The second digit is the same as the first digit, so there is 1 option.\n   - The third digit can be any number from 0 to 9, except the first digit, so there are 9 options.\n   - Total number of combinations for this case: 9 * 1 * 9 = 81.\n\nTotal number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same (but not adjacent) is 81 + 81 = 162.\n\n3. Number of three-digit numbers left after excluding those with exactly two digits the same (but not adjacent):\nTotal number of three-digit numbers - Total number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same (but not adjacent) = 900 - 162.\n\nTherefore, 900 - 162 = 738.\n\nSo, there are 738 three-digit numbers left after excluding those with exactly two digits the same (but not adjacent)."
