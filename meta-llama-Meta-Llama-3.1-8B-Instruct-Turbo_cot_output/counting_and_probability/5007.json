    "problem": "What is the largest $2$-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$?\n",
    "solution": "Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \\choose 100}=\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \\le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$. The largest such prime is $\\boxed{61}$, which is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer ${200\\choose 100}$, we can first express the binomial coefficient as a product of factorials:\n\n${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100! \\cdot 100!}$\n\nThis expression has a lot of factors that can be canceled out. To simplify the calculation, we'll focus on the factors that are not canceled out.\n\nFor the numerator, we have $200!$. This is the product of all integers from 1 to 200.\n\nFor the denominator, we have $100! \\cdot 100!$. This is the product of all integers from 1 to 100, multiplied by itself.\n\nWhen we cancel out the factors, we're left with the product of the integers from 101 to 200, divided by the product of the integers from 1 to 100.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this further. When we expand the product of the integers from 101 to 200, we notice that it includes the product of the integers from 101 to 200, divided by the product of the integers from 1 to 100.\n\nWe can then focus on the remaining factors. These are the factors from 101 to 200, divided by the factors from 1 to 100, but with some simplifications.\n\nNotice that the factors from 1 to 100 are already present in the denominator. So, we can focus on the remaining factors, which are the product of the integers from 101 to 200, divided by the product of the integers from 101 to 200 that are not canceled out.\n\nThe factors that are not canceled out are the product of the integers from 1 to 100. However, we need to consider that some of these factors are canceled out by the numerator.\n\nLet's look at the factors of the numerator. Any factor of the form $\\frac{a!}{b!}$ can be expressed as a product of integers from $b+1$ to $a$. \n\nNow we'll focus on the possible values of the remaining factors. These factors are the product of the integers from 101 to 200, divided by the product of the integers from 1 to 100.\n\nWe know that the remaining factors are not divisible by 2 or 5, as these factors would be canceled out by the denominator. The largest such factor would be $199 \\cdot 197 \\cdot 191 \\cdot 181 \\cdot 179 \\cdot 173 \\cdot 167 \\cdot 163 \\cdot 157 \\cdot 151 \\cdot 149 \\cdot 139 \\cdot 137 \\cdot 131 \\cdot 127 \\cdot 113 \\cdot 109 \\cdot 107 \\cdot 103 \\cdot 101$."
