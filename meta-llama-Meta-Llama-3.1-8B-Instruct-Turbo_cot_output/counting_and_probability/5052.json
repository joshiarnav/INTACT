They fall into three categories: there are those which are entirely contained within a single face of the cube (whose sides are two edges and one face diagonal), those which lie in a plane perpendicular to one face of the cube (whose sides are one edge, one face diagonal and one space diagonal of the cube) and those which lie in a plane oblique to the edges of the cube, whose sides are three face diagonals of the cube.\nEach face of the cube contains ${4\\choose 3} = 4$ triangles of the first type, and there are $6$ faces, so there are $24$ triangles of the first type. Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$, so each triangle of the first type has area $\\frac 12$.\nEach edge of the cube is a side of exactly $2$ of the triangles of the second type, and there are $12$ edges, so there are $24$ triangles of the second type. Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$ and $\\sqrt 2$, so each triangle of the second type has area $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nEach vertex of the cube is associated with exactly one triangle of the third type (whose vertices are its three neighbors), and there are $8$ vertices of the cube, so there are $8$ triangles of the third type. Each of the these is an equilateral triangle with sides of length $\\sqrt 2$, so each triangle of the third type has area $\\frac{\\sqrt 3}2$.\nThus the total area of all these triangles is $24 \\cdot \\frac12 + 24\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt2}2 + 8\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt3}2 = 12 + 12\\sqrt2 + 4\\sqrt3 = 12 + \\sqrt{288} + \\sqrt{48}$ and the answer is $12 + 288 + 48 = \\boxed{348}$.",

This can be done in $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways.\n\nHowever, not all of these triangles are valid (e.g., a triangle with all its vertices at the same point is not valid). We need to subtract the invalid triangles.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the invalid triangles**\n\nThere are $8$ invalid triangles, each formed by choosing $3$ vertices that lie on the same face of the cube.\n\n**Step 5: Identifying the valid triangles**\n\nThe remaining $56 - 8 = 48$ triangles are valid. We can categorize them into three types:\n\n* Triangles contained within a single face of the cube (type 1): $24$ triangles\n* Triangles lying in a plane perpendicular to one face of the cube (type 2): $16$ triangles\n* Triangles lying in a plane oblique to the edges of the cube (type 3): $8$ triangles\n\n**Step 6: Calculating the areas of the triangles**\n\n* Type 1 triangles: These are right-angled triangles with legs of length $1$ and $1.$ Their area is $\\frac{1}{2}.$\n* Type 2 triangles: These are right-angled triangles with legs of length $1$ and $\\sqrt{2}.$ Their area is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}.$\n* Type 3 triangles: These are equilateral triangles with sides of length $\\sqrt{2}.$ Their area is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.$\n\n**Step 7: Calculating the sum of the areas**\n\nThe sum of the areas of all triangles is:\n$24 \\times \\frac{1}{2} + 16 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + 8 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 12 + 4\\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{3} = 12 + \\sqrt{32} + \\sqrt{12}.$\n\n**Step 8: Finding the final answer**\n\nThe final answer is $12 + 32 + 12 = 56.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$"
