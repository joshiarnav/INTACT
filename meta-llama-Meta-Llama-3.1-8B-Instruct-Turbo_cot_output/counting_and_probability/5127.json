    "problem": "A mother purchases 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 2 green plates, and 1 orange plate. How many ways are there for her to arrange these plates for dinner around her circular table if she doesn't want the 2 green plates to be adjacent?\n",
    "solution": "We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.\nThere are $\\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).\nIf the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion. Using the same argument, there are $\\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.\nThus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \\boxed{588}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. \n\nThe total number of plates is 5 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 10 plates.\nThe formula for permutations of a set of objects is n! / (n1! * n2! * n3! ...), where n is the total number of objects and n1, n2, n3, etc., are the repeating objects.\nWe have 10 plates, 5 blue plates (n1), 2 red plates (n2), 2 green plates (n3), and 1 orange plate (n4).\nThe total number of linear arrangements is 10! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!) = 756,360.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion.\nFor a circular arrangement, we need to divide the linear arrangements by the total number of plates, since each circular arrangement has (n-1)! equivalent rotations.\nSo, the total number of circular arrangements is 756,360 / 10 = 75,636.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of circular arrangements where the 2 green plates are adjacent.\nTo do this, we can treat the 2 green plates as a single unit. Now we have 9 objects: 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 1 green-blue unit, and 1 orange plate.\nThe total number of linear arrangements is 9! / (5! * 2! * 1! * 1!) = 181,440.\nThe total number of circular arrangements is 181,440 / 9 = 20,160.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the plates where the 2 green plates are not adjacent.\nThis can be calculated by subtracting the number of circular arrangements where the 2 green plates are adjacent from the total number of circular arrangements.\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the plates where the 2 green plates are not adjacent is 75,636 - 20,160 = 55,476.\n\nTherefore, there are 55,476 ways to arrange the plates for dinner around her circular table such that the 2 green plates are not adjacent."
