    "problem": "If I have a $4\\times 4$ chess board, in how many ways can I place four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row of the board contains no more than one pawn?",
    "solution": "Because our chess board is $4 \\times 4$, there must be exactly one pawn in each column and each row. Consider the ways to place one pawn in each row. In the first row, there are four potential spots for a pawn. However, no matter where we place the pawn, it takes up one column. So, in the second row, there are only three potential spots for a pawn. Similarly, there are two spots in the third row and only one in the fourth. Thus, there are $4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ ways in which we can place the pawns. Now, because each pawn is distinct, we have four possible pawns to place in the first slot, three in the second, two in the fourth, and one in the last. So there are $24$ possible orderings of the pawns. Our final answer is thus $24^2 = \\boxed{576}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can think step by step. We have a 4x4 chessboard and four distinct pawns. We need to place each pawn in a way that each column and row contains no more than one pawn.\n\n**Step 1: Place the first pawn**\nThere are 16 possible squares on the board where we can place the first pawn.\n\n**Step 2: Place the second pawn**\nAfter placing the first pawn, we need to place the second pawn in a way that it does not occupy the same row or column as the first pawn. There are 9 possible squares left where we can place the second pawn (12 possible squares minus 3 squares that share the same row or column with the first pawn).\n\n**Step 3: Place the third pawn**\nAfter placing the first two pawns, we need to place the third pawn in a way that it does not occupy the same row or column as the first two pawns. There are 4 possible squares left where we can place the third pawn (15 possible squares minus 11 squares that share the same row or column with the first two pawns).\n\n**Step 4: Place the fourth pawn**\nAfter placing the first three pawns, we need to place the fourth pawn in a way that it does not occupy the same row or column as the first three pawns. There is only 1 possible square left where we can place the fourth pawn (13 possible squares minus 12 squares that share the same row or column with the first three pawns).\n\nSince the order in which we place the pawns matters, we need to multiply the number of possibilities at each step. However, the question doesn't ask for the number of ways to order the pawns, only the number of ways to place them. \n\nThe total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns is 16 * 9 * 4 * 1 = 576."
