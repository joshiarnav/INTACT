    "problem": "Crestview's school colors are purple and gold. The students are designing a flag using three solid-colored horizontal stripes, as shown. Using one or both of the school colors, how many different flags are possible if adjacent stripes may be the same color?\n\n[asy]\nsize(75);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,12));\ndot((0,12));\ndraw((0,12)--(8,12)--(8,11)--(0,11));\ndraw((8,11)--(8,9)--(0,9));\ndraw((8,9)--(8,6)--(0,6));\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "There are two possible colors for the first stripe, two possible colors for the second stripe, and two possible colors for the third stripe. Since the colors of each stripe are mutually exclusive, there are $2\\times 2 \\times 2 = \\boxed{8}$ ways to color the flag.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's think about the possible color combinations for each stripe.\n\n1. The top stripe can be one of two colors: purple or gold. So, there are 2 possibilities for the top stripe.\n\n2. Now, the middle stripe can also be either purple or gold. Since adjacent stripes may be the same color, there are again 2 possibilities for the middle stripe.\n\n3. The bottom stripe also has 2 possibilities: purple or gold.\n\nSince each stripe has 2 possibilities, the total number of different flags can be found by multiplying the number of possibilities for each stripe:\n\n2 (top stripe) * 2 (middle stripe) * 2 (bottom stripe) = 8\n\nTherefore, there are 8 different flags possible using one or both of the school colors, Crestview's purple and gold."
