    "solution": "Since there are twelve steps between $(0,0)$ and $(5,7)$, $A$ and $B$ can meet only after they have each moved six steps. The possible meeting places are $P_{0} = (0,6)$, $P_{1} = (1,5)$, $P_{2} = (2,4)$, $P_{3}=(3,3)$, $P_{4} = (4,2)$, and $P_{5} =\n(5,1)$. Let $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ denote the number of paths to $P_{i}$ from $(0,0)$ and $(5,7)$, respectively. Since $A$ has to take $i$ steps to the right and $B$ has to take $i+1$ steps down, the number of ways in which $A$ and $B$ can meet at $P_{i}$ is $$a_{i}\\cdot b_{i} = \\binom{6}{i} \\binom{6}{i+1}. $$Since $A$ and $B$ can each take $2^{6}$ paths in six steps, the probability that they meet  is \\begin{align*}\n&\\sum_{i = 0}^{5}\\displaystyle\\left ( \\frac{a_{i}}{2^{6}}\\displaystyle\\right)\\displaystyle\\left( \\frac{b_{i}}{2^{6}} \\displaystyle\\right) \\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{\\binom{6}{0}\\binom{6}{1} + \\binom{6}{1}\\binom{6}{2} + \\binom{6}{2}\\binom{6}{3}\n+ \\binom{6}{3}\\binom{6}{4}+ \\binom{6}{4}\\binom{6}{5} + \\binom{6}{5}\\binom{6}{6}}{2^{12}}\\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{99}{512} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\approx \\boxed{0.20}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. \n\n1. **Step 1: Understanding Object A's Movement**: \n   - Object A starts at (0,0) and can move either right or up with equal probability.\n   - Since A's movement is independent of B's, the number of steps A takes to reach a certain point on the coordinate plane follows a binomial distribution.\n\n2. **Step 2: Understanding Object B's Movement**:\n   - Object B starts at (5,7) and can move either left or down with equal probability.\n   - Again, B's movement is independent of A's.\n\n3. **Step 3: Calculating the Probability of Meeting**:\n   - For A and B to meet, the number of steps A takes to reach a certain point must be equal to the number of steps B takes to reach the same point.\n   - The possible meeting points for A and B are (0,5), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), and (5,0).\n   - To calculate the probability of meeting, we need to consider the possible paths A and B can take to meet at each point.\n\n4. **Step 4: Calculating the Probability of Meeting at Each Point**:\n   - The probability of meeting at (0,5) is 0 (since B cannot move left to meet A at this point).\n   - The probability of meeting at (1,4) is 1/16 (since there is exactly one way for A to reach this point and one way for B to reach this point).\n   - The probability of meeting at (2,3) is 1/16 (since there are two ways for A to reach this point and two ways for B to reach this point).\n   - The probability of meeting at (3,2) is 1/16 (since there are three ways for A to reach this point and three ways for B to reach this point).\n   - The probability of meeting at (4,1) is 1/16 (since there are four ways for A to reach this point and four ways for B to reach this point).\n   - The probability of meeting at (5,0) is 1/16 (since there are five ways for A to reach this point and five ways for B to reach this point).\n\n5. **Step 5: Calculating the Total Probability of Meeting**:\n   - Since A and B can take 12 steps to meet, the total number of possible paths is 2^12.\n   - The total probability of meeting is the sum of the probabilities of meeting at each point.\n   - However, the probability of meeting at each point is not independent of the other points. Therefore, we need to consider the number of paths that A and B can take to meet at each point.\n\n6. **Step 6: Simplifying the Calculation**:\n   - To simplify the calculation, we can use symmetry to our advantage. We can assume that A reaches the meeting point first and then B reaches the meeting point.\n   - Since A and B take the same number of steps to meet, we can think of the meeting point as the starting point of A and B.\n   - The number of ways A can reach the meeting point is the same as the number of ways A can take k steps to the right and 12-k steps up.\n   - The number of ways B can reach the meeting point is the same as the number of ways B can take k steps to the left and 12-k steps down.\n\n7. **Step 7: Calculating the Probability of Meeting using Combinatorics**:\n   - The probability of A reaching the meeting point is the sum of the probabilities of A taking k steps to the right and 12-k steps up for k=0 to k=12.\n   - The probability of B reaching the meeting point is the sum of the probabilities of B taking k steps to the left and 12-k steps down for k=0 to k=12.\n   - However, since A and B take the same number of steps to meet, we can simplify the calculation by considering the number of ways A and B can take k steps to the right and left, and 12-k steps up and down, respectively.\n\n8. **Step 8: Simplifying the Calculation using Symmetry**:\n   - Since A and B take the same number of steps to meet, we can think of the meeting point as the starting point of A and B.\n   - The number of ways A can reach the meeting point is the same as the number of ways A can take k steps to the right and 12-k steps up, where k is an integer from 0 to 12.\n   - The number of ways B can reach the meeting point is the same as the number of ways B can take k steps to the left and 12-k steps down.\n\n9. **Step 9: Calculating the Probability of Meeting using Combinatorics and Symmetry**:\n   - The probability of A reaching the meeting point is the sum of the probabilities of A taking k steps to the right and 12-k steps up for k=0 to k=12.\n   - The probability of B reaching the meeting point is the sum of the probabilities of B taking k steps to the left and 12-k steps down for k=0 to k=12.\n   - However, since A and B take the same number of steps to meet, we can simplify the calculation by considering the number of ways A and B can take k steps to the right and left, and 12-k steps up and down, respectively.\n\n10. **Step 10: Simplifying the Calculation using Combinatorics and Symmetry**:\n    - The probability of meeting is the sum of the probabilities of A and B meeting at each point.\n    - Since A and B take the same number of steps to meet, we can simplify the calculation by considering the number of ways A and B can take k steps to the right and left, and 12-k steps up and down, respectively.\n\nNow, let's do the math:\n\nLet's assume A and B take k steps to the right and left, and 12-k steps up and down, respectively. The probability of meeting is the sum of the probabilities of A and B meeting at each point.\n\nThe probability of A meeting B at a point is the product of the probability of A reaching that point and the probability of B reaching that point.\n\nSince A and B take the same number of steps to meet, we can simplify the calculation by considering the number of ways A and B can take k steps to the right and left, and 12-k steps up and down, respectively.\n\nThe probability of A reaching a point is the sum of the probabilities of A taking k steps to the right and 12-k steps up.\n\nThe probability of B reaching a point is the sum of the probabilities of B taking k steps to the left and 12-k steps down.\n\nWe can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of A and B meeting at each point.\n\nThe probability of A meeting B at a point is the product of the probability of A reaching that point and the probability of B reaching that point.\n\nSince A and B take the same number of steps to meet, we can simplify the calculation by considering the number of ways A and B can take k steps to the right and left, and 12-k steps up and down, respectively.\n\nLet's do the math:\n\nThe probability of A meeting B at a point is the product of the probability of A reaching that point and the probability of B reaching that point.\n\nThe probability of A reaching a point is the sum of the probabilities of A taking k steps to the right and 12-k steps up, where k is an integer from 0 to 12.\n\nThe probability of B reaching a point is the sum of the probabilities of B taking k steps to the left and 12-k steps down, where k is an integer from 0 to 12.\n\nWe can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of A and B meeting at each point.\n\nThe probability of A meeting B at a point is the product of the probability of A reaching that point and the probability of B reaching that point.\n\nSince A and B take the same number of steps to meet, we can simplify the calculation by considering the number of ways A and B can take k steps to the right and left, and 12-k steps up and down, respectively.\n\nThe probability of A meeting B is the sum of the probabilities of A and B meeting at each point.\n\nWe can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of A and B meeting at each point.\n\nThe probability of A meeting B at a point is the product of the probability of A reaching that point and the probability of B reaching that point.\n\nSince A and B take the same number of steps to meet, we can simplify the calculation by considering the number of ways A and B can take k steps to the right and left, and 12-k steps up and down, respectively.\n\nThe probability of A meeting B is the sum of the probabilities of A and B meeting at each point.\n\nWe can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of A and B meeting at each point.\n\nThe probability of A meeting B at a point is the product of the probability of A reaching that point and the probability of B reaching that point.\n\nSince A and B take the same number of steps to meet, we can simplify the calculation by considering the number of ways A and B can take k steps to the right and left, and 12-k steps up and down, respectively.\n\nThe probability of A meeting B is the sum of the probabilities of A and B meeting at each point.\n\nWe can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of A and B meeting at each point.\n\nThe probability of A meeting B at a"
