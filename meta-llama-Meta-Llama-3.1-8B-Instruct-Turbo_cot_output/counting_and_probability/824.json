    "problem": "I have a drawer with 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives in it. If I reach in and randomly remove three pieces of silverware, what is the probability that I get one fork, one spoon, and one knife?",
    "solution": "First, we can find the denominator of our fraction.  There are a total of $\\dbinom{18}{3}=816$ ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18.  To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of silverware.  There are 6 ways we could choose a fork, 6 ways to choose a spoon, and 6 ways to choose a knife, making a total of $6\\cdot 6 \\cdot 6=216$ ways to choose a fork, a knife, and a spoon so our final probability is $\\frac{216}{816}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware**\n\nSince we have a total of 18 pieces of silverware (6 forks + 6 spoons + 6 knives) and we're choosing 3 of them, we can use combinations to calculate the total number of ways. The formula for combinations is:\n\nnCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (18 in this case), and r is the number of items we're choosing (3 in this case).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware is:\n\n18C3 = 18! / (3! \u00d7 (18-3)!)\n= 18! / (3! \u00d7 15!)\n= (18 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 16) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n= 816\n\nThere are 816 ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware from the drawer.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife**\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife. We have 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one fork is 6 (since there are 6 forks).\nThe number of ways to choose one spoon is 6 (since there are 6 spoons).\nThe number of ways to choose one knife is 6 (since there are 6 knives).\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife, we multiply the number of ways to choose each one:\n\n6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 = 216\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability**\n\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (choosing one fork, one spoon, and one knife) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (choosing any 3 pieces of silverware).\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n= 216 / 816\n= 27 / 102\n= 9 / 34\n\nSo, the probability of randomly selecting one fork, one spoon, and one knife from the drawer is 9/34."
