    "problem": "When two fair 6-sided dice are tossed, the numbers $a$ and $b$ are obtained. What is the probability that the two digit number $ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) and $a$ and $b$ are all divisible by 3?",
    "solution": "$ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) is divisible by 3 only when $a+b$ is divisible by 3. Since 3 divides both $a$ and $a+b$, 3 must divide $b$. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ can equal 3 or 6. The probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. The probability that $b$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. Therefore, The probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6 is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac19}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's consider the possible outcomes of rolling two 6-sided dice. Each die can land on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. There are 6 possible outcomes for the first die and 6 possible outcomes for the second die, giving a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes.\n\nFor the two-digit number $ab$ to be divisible by 3, the sum of $a$ and $b$ must be divisible by 3. This means that $a$ and $b$ must both be either 0 (not possible since they are the numbers on the dice), 3, or 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of $a$ and $b$ that are both divisible by 3:\n\n- Both $a$ and $b$ are 3: (3, 3)\n- Both $a$ and $b$ are 6: (6, 6)\n\nAdditionally, the numbers $a$ and $b$ must also be divisible by 3 when considered individually, which they are in the cases above. However, there are a few more combinations that also work: \n\n- $a$ is 3 and $b$ is 6: (3, 6), (6, 3)\n- $a$ is 6 and $b$ is 3: (3, 6), (6, 3)\n\nThis gives us a total of 5 combinations.\n\nHowever, we can see that the cases where a is 3 and b is 6 and where a is 6 and b is 3 are essentially the same cases and should only be counted once.\n\nThis means the probability that the two-digit number $ab$, and $a$ and $b$ are all divisible by 3 is $\\frac{2}{36}$."
