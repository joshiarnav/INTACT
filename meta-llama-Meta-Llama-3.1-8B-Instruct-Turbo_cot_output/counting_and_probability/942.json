    "model_solution": "To find the different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, we can think of it as finding the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the set. \n\nHowever, we need to consider all possible combinations of differences, not just the largest and smallest elements. \n\nFor any two distinct elements $a$ and $b$ in the set, the difference $|a-b|$ will be a positive integer. Since we want to find the different positive integers, we can start by finding the range of possible differences.\n\nThe smallest possible difference is $|1-2|=1$ and the largest possible difference is $|1-16|=15$. \n\nNow, let's consider the differences between consecutive elements in the set. For example, the difference between $2$ and $1$ is $1$, the difference between $3andum 2$ is $1$, and so on. \n\nIn this case, we can see that all differences between consecutive elements are $1$. \n\nHowever, when we consider the differences between non-consecutive elements, we get a range of values. \n\nFor example, the difference between $2$ and $1$ is $1$, the difference between $3$ and $1$ is $2$, the difference between $4$ and $1$ is $3$, and so on.\n\nIn general, the difference between any two elements $a$ and $b$ in the set is given by $|a-b|$. \n\nTo find the range of possible differences, we can consider the minimum and maximum values of $|a-b|$.\n\nThe minimum value of $|a-b|$ is $1$ when $a=2$ and $b=1$. \n\nThe maximum value of $|a-b|$ is $15$ when $a=1$ and $b=16$.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are distinct elements in the set, we can conclude that the range of possible differences is from $1$ to $15$.\n\nHowever, we need to count the number of integers in this range, not just the range itself. \n\nThe integers in this range are $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 15$, which are a total of $15$ integers.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{15}$ different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set."
