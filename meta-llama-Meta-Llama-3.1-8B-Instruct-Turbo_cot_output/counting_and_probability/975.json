    "solution": "The hexagons in the second column to the left must be yellow and green, but either color can be on top: 2 possibilities. With either possibility, the rest of the figure is easily colored in, with the color of every other hexagon being forced.  (ex. In the third column, the middle hexagon must be red, and the top and bottom must be the opposite of the top and bottom in the second column)  Thus, there are only $\\boxed{2}$ possibilities.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's start by considering the constraints given in the problem statement. \n\n1. No two hexagons with a common side are colored the same color. \n\nNow, let's consider the coloring of each hexagon step by step:\n\n1. The hexagon with the R is colored red. This hexagon is surrounded by six other hexagons. \n\n2. The two hexagons directly below the red hexagon must be colored yellow and green, but it doesn't matter which one is which. We can choose one of them to be yellow and the other to be green. So, there are 2 ways to color these two hexagons.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the hexagons directly to the left of the red hexagon. These three hexagons must be colored yellow, green, and red, but the order doesn't matter. However, since the top one must be green, the middle one must be yellow, and the bottom one must be red. So, there is only 1 way to color these three hexagons.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the hexagons directly to the right of the red hexagon. These three hexagons must be colored yellow, green, and red, but the order doesn't matter. However, since the top one must be green, the middle one must be yellow, and the bottom one must be red. So, there is only 1 way to color these three hexagons.\n\n5. Now, let's consider the remaining hexagons. The top one must be yellow, the middle one must be green, and the bottom one must be red. So, there is only 1 way to color these three hexagons.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible ways to color the figure is the product of the number of ways to color each set of hexagons: 2 x 1 x 1 x 1 = 2.\n\nSo, there are 2 different ways to color the figure."
