    "problem": "The area of an equilateral triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. What is the perimeter of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "solution": "The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$. This must equal $s$. Setting the two equal and solving, we get \\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\\\\n4s&=s^2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4 &= s\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4\\sqrt{3}&= 3s \\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} &=s\n\\end{align*} Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is $3s=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}} \\text{units}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle, we first need to understand the properties of an equilateral triangle and how the area is related to its side length.\n\nThe area (A) of an equilateral triangle with side length (s) is given by the formula:\nA = (\u221a3 / 4) * s^2\n\nWe are given that the area is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides, so we can write:\nA = s\n\nSubstituting this into the area formula, we get:\ns = (\u221a3 / 4) * s^2\n\nTo solve for s, we can rearrange this equation:\ns / s^2 = \u221a3 / 4\n1 / s = \u221a3 / 4\ns = 4 / \u221a3\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \u221a3:\ns = (4 * \u221a3) / (\u221a3 * \u221a3)\ns = (4 * \u221a3) / 3\n\nNow that we have the side length (s), we can find the perimeter (P) of the triangle, which is the sum of all three sides:\nP = 3s\nP = 3 * (4 * \u221a3) / 3\nP = 4 * \u221a3\n\nSo, the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 4\u221a3 units."
