    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?",
    "solution": "Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the equation of line L, we first need to understand the concept of reflection. When a point (x, y) is reflected about a line L with equation y = mx + b, its image is the point (x', y') where:\n\nx' = x \ny' = 2b - y \n\nHowever, given information about the coordinates of original and reflected points, we are going to look for a horizontal or vertical line.\n\nLooking at the coordinates of the original points A (2,3) and its reflected image A'(2,-5), we can see that the only change in the coordinates is in the y-value, which changes from 3 to -5, while the x-value remains the same (2). This suggests that the line of reflection L is a horizontal line.\n\nSince the y-value of A changes by 8 units and the y-value of A' is -5, the y-value of line L can be determined by taking the midpoint between the y-value of A (3) and the y-value of A' (-5). The midpoint formula is (y1+y2)/2.\n\nMidpoint = (3 + (-5))/2 = -1.\n\nSo the equation of the line L, which is a horizontal line, can be written as y = -1."
