    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has vertices at $A(5,8)$, $B(3,-2)$, and $C(6,1)$. The point $D$ with coordinates $(m,n)$ is chosen inside the triangle so that the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$ and $BCD$ all have equal areas. What is the value of $10m + n$?",
    "solution": "If $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, then $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ would all have equal areas (to see this, remember that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into 6 equal areas). There is only one point with this property (if we move around $D$, the area of one of the small triangles will increase and will no longer be $1/3$ of the total area). So $D$ must be the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the centroid are found by averaging the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the vertices, so $(m,n) = \\left( \\frac{5+3+6}{3}, \\frac{8+(-2)+1}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$, and $10m + n = 10 \\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) + \\frac{7}{3} = \\boxed{49}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll consider the properties of the centroid of a triangle, which divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area. The centroid is also the point of intersection of the medians of the triangle.\n\nGiven the vertices $A(5,8)$, $B(3,-2)$, and $C(6,1)$, we can calculate the coordinates of the centroid, which will be the point $D(m,n)$. \n\nThe formula to calculate the centroid $(m,n)$ of a triangle with vertices $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$, and $(x_3,y_3)$ is:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3} \\]\n\\[ n = \\frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3} \\]\n\nApplying the formula to the given vertices:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{5 + 3 + 6}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} \\]\n\\[ n = \\frac{8 - 2 + 1}{3} = \\frac{7}{3} \\]\n\nNow that we have the coordinates of point $D$, we can calculate the value of $10m + n$:\n\n\\[ 10m + n = 10\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) + \\frac{7}{3} \\]\n\\[ 10m + n = \\frac{140}{3} + \\frac{7}{3} \\]\n\\[ 10m + n = \\frac{147}{3} \\]\n\\[ 10m + n = 49 \\]\n\nSo, the value of $10m + n$ is $49$."
