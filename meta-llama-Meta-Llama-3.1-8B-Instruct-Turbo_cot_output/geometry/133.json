    "model_solution": "To find the area of the hexagon, we can divide it into smaller shapes to make the calculation easier.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the right half of the hexagon, which is a trapezoid with two triangles attached to it.\n\n- The trapezoid is formed by the points (1, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), and (3, -3). It has two parallel sides with lengths 3 units and 6 units (distance between the points (1, 3) and (3, 3), and the points (3, -3) and (4, 0), respectively), and a height of 3 units. We can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid, which is given by (a + b)h/2, where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the parallel sides and 'h' is the height.\n\n- Using the formula, the area of the trapezoid is (3 + 6) * 3 / 2 = 27 / 2 square units.\n\n- Now, we need to find the area of the two triangles. Both triangles are right-angled and have a base of 1 unit and a height of 3 units. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is given by (base * height) / 2.\n\n- Using the formula, the area of each triangle is (1 * 3) / 2 = 1.5 square units.\n\n- Since both triangles have the same area, the combined area of the two triangles is 2 * 1.5 = 3 square units.\n\n- Now, we can find the area of the right half of the hexagon by adding the areas of the trapezoid and the two triangles, which is 27 / 2 + 3 = 33 / 2 square units.\n\n- Since the hexagon is symmetric, the area of the left half is the same as the area of the right half, which is 33 / 2 square units.\n\n- Therefore, the area of the entire hexagon is 2 * 33 / 2 = 33 square units.\n\n- However, this is not the correct solution, since we need to remove some area to make sure that it is the area of the hexagon but not of the larger rectangle."
