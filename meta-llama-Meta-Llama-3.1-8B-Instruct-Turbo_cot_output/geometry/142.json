    "model_solution": "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Recall the Definition of Sine\n\nThe sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle.\n\n### Step 2: Use a Right-Angled Triangle\n\nLet's consider a right-angled triangle with angles $30^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $90^\\circ$. The side opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle is the side with length $x$. The side adjacent to the $60^\\circ$ angle is the side with length $x\\sqrt{3}$. The hypotenuse of the triangle is the side with length $2x$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the PythagTheorem\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we know that the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse. Let's apply this to our triangle:\n\n$$(x\\sqrt{3})^2 + x^2 = (2x)^2$$\n\n### Step 4: Solve for x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$3x^2 + x^2 = 4x^2$$\n\nSubtracting $3x^2$ from both sides:\n\n$$x^2 = x^2$$\n\nAdding $4x^2$ to both sides:\n\n$$7x^2 = 4x^2$$\n\nSubtracting $4x^2$ from both sides:\n\n$$3x^2 = 0$$\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\n$$x^2 = 0$$\n\nSince $x^2 = 0$, we have $x = 0$. This is not a valid solution for our triangle. We need to find a different approach to solve for $x$.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Trigonometric Identity\n\nUsing the definition of sine and the properties of the triangle, we can write:\n\n$$\\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{x}{2x}$$\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n$$\\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThis is the value of $\\sin 60^\\circ$.\n\nSo, the value of $\\sin 60^\\circ$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
