It is given that \\[140=4a+4b+4c{\\qquad \\rm and\n\\qquad}21=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}\\] hence \\[35=a+b+c{\\qquad (1)\\qquad\n\\rm and\\qquad}441=a^2+b^2+c^2{\\qquad (2)}.\\]\n\nSquare both sides of $(1)$ and combine with $(2)$ to obtain \\begin{align*}\n1225 & = (a+b+c)^2 \\\\\n&= a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca \\\\\n&= 441+2ab+2bc+2ca.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus the surface area of the box is \\[ 2ab+2bc+2ca=1225-441=\\boxed{784}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the length, width, and height of the rectangular box as $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively.\n\nStep 2: We are given that the sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the box is 140. Since there are 4 edges of length $a$, 4 edges of length $b$, and 4 edges of length $c$, we can write an equation:\n\n$4a + 4b + 4c = 140$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$a + b + c = 35$\n\nStep 3: We are also given that the distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is 21. This is equal to the space diagonal of the box, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 21$\n\nSquaring both sides of this equation, we get:\n\n$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 441$\n\nStep 4: Now, we need to find the total surface area of the box. The total surface area of a rectangular box is equal to the sum of the areas of its six faces. This can be written as:\n\n$2(ab + ac + bc)$\n\nStep 5: To find the total surface area, we need to find the values of $ab + ac + bc$. We can rewrite the equation from Step 2 as:\n\n$(a + b + c)^2 = 1225$\n\nExpanding the left-hand side of this equation, we get:\n\n$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) = 1225$\n\nSubstituting the value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ from Step 3, we get:\n\n$441 + 2(ab + ac + bc) = 1225$\n\nSubtracting 441 from both sides, we get:\n\n$2(ab + ac + bc) = 784$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$ab + ac + bc = 392$\n\nStep 6: Now that we have the value of $ab + ac + bc$, we can find the total surface area of he box. Substituting this value into the equation from Step 4, we get:\n\n$2(ab + ac + bc) = 2(392)$\n\n$= 784$\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the box is 784."
