    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$, let's start by understanding the constraints of the problem.\n\nGiven:\n- Perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is 2007 units.\n- Sides have lengths that are all integer values.\n- $AB < BC \\leq AC$.\n\nWe can represent the perimeter as: \n$AB + BC + AC = 2007$\n\nSince $AB$ and $BC$ are sides of the triangle, we can apply the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. \n\nGiven the constraints, let's consider the case where $AB$ and $BC$ are as close as possible, while still satisfying the triangle inequality. We can express $AB$ and $BC$ as $x$ and $x+d$, where $x$ is an integer and $d$ is a positive integer representing the difference between $BC$ and $AB$. \n\nGiven the constraint $AB < BC \\leq AC$, we have the following inequalities:\n- $AB + BC > AC$ \n- $AB + AC > BC$\n- $BC + AC > AB$\n\nSubstituting $AB = x$ and $BC = x+d$, we have:\n- $x + (x+d) > AC$\n- $x + AC > (x+d)$\n- $(x+d) + AC > x$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n- $2x + d > AC$\n- $AC > d$\n- $AC + d > x$\n\nWe can also express the perimeter as:\n$AB + BC + AC = 2007$\n$(x) + (x+d) + AC = 2007$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n- $2x + d + AC = 2007$\n\nSince $2x + d > AC$ and $2x + d + AC = 2007$, we can substitute $AC = 2007 - 2x - d$ into the inequality $2x + d > AC$.\n\nWe get:\n$2x + d > 2007 - 2x - d$\n$4x + 2d > 2007$\n$2x + d > \\frac{2007}{2}$\n$d > 1003 - x$\n\nTo minimize $d$, which is equivalent to minimizing $BC - AB$, we want to maximize $x$. Since $2x + d > AC$ and $d > 1003 - x$, we can see that $x$ has an upper bound. \n\nTo find the upper bound of $x$, let's consider the case where $AC$ is as small as possible, while still greater than $x + d$. We want to minimize $AC$, so we set $AC = x + d$. \n\nWe have the following inequalities:\n- $AC > d$\n- $AC \\geq BC$\n- $AC \\leq AC$\n\nGiven $AC = x + d$, we can see that $AC \\geq BC$ is always satisfied, since $BC = x + d$. \n\nWe have $AC > d$, which is always satisfied. \n\nWe also have $AC \\leq AC$, which is always satisfied.\n\nHowever, we also have $2x + d > AC$, which gives us $2x + d > x + d$. \n\nSimplifying, we have $x > 0$, which is always satisfied.\n\nWe also have $2x + d + AC = 2007$, which gives us $2x + d + x + d = 2007$. \n\nSimplifying, we have $3x + 2d = 2007$.\n\nSince $d > 1003 - x$, the maximum value of $x$ occurs when $d = 1003 - x$. \n\nSubstituting $d = 1003 - x$ into the equation $3x + 2d = 2007$, we get:\n$3x + 2(1003 - x) = 2007$\n$3x + 2006 - 2x = 2007$\n$x + 2006 = 2007$\n$x = 1$\n\nSubstituting $x = 1$ into the equation $d = 1003 - x$, we get:\n$d = 1003 - 1$\n$d = 1002$\n\nSince $d = BC - AB$ and $d = 1002$, the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$ is $\\boxed{1}$."
