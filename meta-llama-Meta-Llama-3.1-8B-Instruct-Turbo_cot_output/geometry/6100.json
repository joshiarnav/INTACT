    "solution": "The line passing through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right and through the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it is the line we are looking for: a line passing through the tangency of two circles cuts congruent areas, so our line cuts through the four aforementioned circles splitting into congruent areas, and there are an additional two circles on each side. The line passes through $\\left(1,\\frac 12\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac 32,2\\right)$, which can be easily solved to be $6x = 2y + 5$. Thus, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = \\boxed{65}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n1. **Find the total area of the packed circles**: The total area of the eight circles will be used to determine the area of each region that the line divides.\n\n2. **Determine the line that divides the region into two equal parts**: Given that the line has a slope of 3, we need to find its equation. Since the line divides the region equally, it must pass through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right. It also passes through the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it.\n\n3. **Find the equation of the line**: We will use the two points obtained in the previous step to find the equation of the line. The equation will be in the form $ax = by + c$.\n\n4. **Calculate the final answer**: Once we have the equation of the line, we will calculate the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. Then we will compute the sum of their squares, which is $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$.\n\n\nNow let's start solving the problem step by step.\n## Step 1: Find the total area of the packed circles\n\nThe area of each circle is $\\pi\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\nSince there are 8 circles in total, the area of the 8 circles combined is $8 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 2\\pi$.\n\n\n## Step 2: Determine the line that divides the region into two equal parts\n\nThe line passes through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right. This tangency point is at $(1,1)$. The line also passes through the tangency point of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it. This point is at $(2,3)$.\n\nWe can use these two points to find the slope of the line. However, we already know that the slope of the line is 3 from the given information, so we can proceed to find the equation of the line.\n\n\n## Step 3: Find the equation of the line\n\nThe equation of a line passing through two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:\n\n$$y-y_1=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\cdot (x-x_1)$$\n\nUsing the points $(1,1)$ and $(2,3)$, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny-1&=\\frac{3-1}{2-1}\\cdot (x-1)\\\\\ny-1&=2(x-1)\\\\\ny-1&=2x-2\\\\\ny&=2x-1\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe want the equation of the line to be in the form $ax = by + c$. To convert the equation to this form, we can swap $x$ and $y$ and rearrange terms:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny&=2x-1\\\\\nx-\\frac{1}{2}y&=1\\\\\n2x-1&=2y\\\\\n2x-2y&=1\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we have the equation of the line in the desired form: $2x-2y=1$.\n\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final answer\n\nThe equation of the line is $2x-2y=1$. Comparing this to the form $ax = by + c$, we get $a=2$, $b=2$, and $c=1$. Now we can compute the sum of their squares:\n\n$$a^2+b^2+c^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9$$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
