    "problem": "Two points $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$ are chosen on the graph of $f(x) = \\ln x$, with $0 < x_1 < x_2$. The points $C$ and $D$ trisect $\\overline{AB}$, with $AC < CB$. Through $C$ a horizontal line is drawn to cut the curve at $E(x_3, y_3)$. Find $x_3$ if $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1000$.\n",
    "solution": "Since $C$ is the trisector of line segment $\\overline{AB}$ closer to $A$, the $y$-coordinate of $C$ is equal to two thirds the $y$-coordinate of $A$ plus one third the $y$-coordinate of $B$. Thus, point $C$ has coordinates $(x_0, \\frac{2}{3} \\ln 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000) = (x_0, \\ln 10)$ for some $x_0$. Then the horizontal line through $C$ has equation $y = \\ln 10$, and this intersects the curve $y = \\ln x$ at the point $(10, \\ln 10)$, so $x_3 = \\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find $x_3$, we need to follow the steps below:\n\n1. **Find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$**: Since $f(x) = \\ln x$, we can find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ using the given function.\nFor point $A(x_1, y_1)$, we have $x_1 = 1$ and $y_1 = \\ln 1 = 0$.\n\nFor point $B(x_2, y_2)$, we have $x_2 = 1000$ and $y_2 = \\ln 1000$.\n\n2. **Find the coordinates of $C$ and $D$**: Since $C$ and $D$ trisect $\\overline{AB}$, we need to find the coordinates of $C$ first. The $y$-coordinate of $C$ is one-third of the $y$-coordinate of $B$ plus the $y$-coordinate of $A$. \n\nLet's denote the $y$-coordinate of $C$ as $y_C$. Then,\n$y_C = \\frac{1}{3}(y_2 - y_1) + y_1 = \\frac{1}{3}(\\ln 1000) + 0$\n\nThe $x$-coordinate of $C$ can be found using the section formula, which gives the $x$-coordinate of a point that divides a line segment into a particular ratio. \n\nHowever, we can also use the fact that $AC < CB$, which means $C$ is closer to $A$. Since the line segments $AC$ and $CB$ are in a $1:2$ ratio, we can find the $x$-coordinate of $C$ as $x_C = \\frac{1 \\cdot x_2 + 2 \\cdot x_1}{1 + 2} = \\frac{x_2 + 2x_1}{3}$.\n\nIn our case, $x_C = \\frac{1000 + 2 \\cdot 1}{3} = \\frac{1002}{3}$.\n\n3. **Draw the horizontal line through $C$ and find the point of intersection with the curve**: Since the line is horizontal, the $y$-coordinate of $E$ will be the same as the $y$-coordinate of $C$, i.e., $y_E = y_C = \\frac{1}{3}(\\ln 1000)$.\n\nSince the curve $y = \\ln x$ has $y = \\ln x$ as its equation, we can substitute $y_E$ into the equation to find $x_E$:\n$\\ln x_E = y_E = \\frac{1}{3}(\\ln 1000)$\n\nSolving this equation, we get $x_E = e^{\\frac{1}{3}(\\ln 1000)} = e^{\\ln(1000^{\\frac{1}{3}})} = 10$.\n\nTherefore, $x_3 = 10$."
