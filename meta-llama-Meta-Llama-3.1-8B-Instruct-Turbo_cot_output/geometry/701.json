    "solution": "$\\triangle ABC$ is a right isosceles ($45^\\circ - 45^\\circ - 90^\\circ$) triangle, so $AC=AB\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}$.  Thus, the side length of the octagon is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe can compute the octagon's area by subtracting the area of the four right isosceles triangles from the area of square $BDEF$.\n\nThe four right isosceles triangles are congruent by symmetry and each has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1 \\cdot 1$, so their total area is \\[4\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 2.\\]  Each side of square $BDEF$ is comprised of a leg of a right isosceles triangle, a side of the octagon, and another leg of a different right isosceles triangle.  Hence, the side length of $BDEF$ is $1+\\sqrt{2}+1=2+\\sqrt{2}$, and the area of $BDEF$ is \\[(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4+2+4\\sqrt{2}.\\] Finally, the area of the octagon is \\[4+2+4\\sqrt{2} - 2 = \\boxed{4+4\\sqrt{2}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the regular octagon, we first need to determine the length of one of its side. \n\nLet's start by focusing on triangle $ABC$. Since we are given that $AB = BC = 1$, we can see that triangle $ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle. \n\nNow, we need to find the length of $AC$. Since triangle $ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle, the length of $AC$ will be $\\sqrt{(AB)^2 + (BC)^2}$. \n\n$\\sqrt{(AB)^2 + (BC)^2} = \\sqrt{(1)^2 + (1)^2}$\n$\\sqrt{(AB)^2 + (BC)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}$\n\nSo, the length of $AC$ is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNext, let's focus on square $BDEF$. Since $AB = BC = 1$ and $AC = \\sqrt{2}$, we can see that the side length of square $BDEF$ will be $AC + AB = \\sqrt{2} + 1$.\n\nSince $ACD$ is a right angle, we know that the side length of square $BDEF$ will be equal to the length of $AC + BD$. But we already know that $AC = \\sqrt{2}$ and as triangle $ABC$ is right angled, the length of $AB$ is $1$ and as triangle $ABC$ is right angled, the length of $BC$ is also $1$.\n\nGiven the length of $AC$ and $BC$, we can also see that $AD$ will be equal to the length of $AC + CD$. Therefore, the length of $AD$ is $\\sqrt{2} + 2$.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the regular octagon. \n\nThe area of the octagon will be equal to the area of the square $BDEF$ minus the area of the four isosceles right triangles $MAB$, $NBC$, $ACD$ and $BDF$.\n\nThe side length of square $BDEF$ is $\\sqrt{2} + 1$, so the area of the square will be $(\\sqrt{2} + 1)^2 = 3 + 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the four isosceles right triangles $MAB$, $NBC$, $ACD$ and $BDF$. \n\nEach of these triangles has sides of length $1$ and $\\sqrt{2}$, so the area of each triangle is $(1 \\times \\sqrt{2})/2 = 0.5\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince there are four triangles, the total area of the triangles will be $4 \\times 0.5\\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the octagon by subtracting the total area of the triangles from the area of the square.\n\nArea of the octagon = Area of the square - Total area of the triangles\nArea of the octagon = $(3 + 2\\sqrt{2}) - (2\\sqrt{2})$\nArea of the octagon = $3$\n\nTherefore, the area of the regular octagon is 3 square units."
