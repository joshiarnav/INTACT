    "problem": "Amy and Belinda each roll a sheet of 6-inch by 8-inch paper to form a cylindrical tube. Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together without overlap. Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together without overlap. What is $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes?",
    "solution": "Amy's cylinder has a height of 8 and a base circumference of 6.  Let her cylinder have volume $V_A$ and radius $r_A$; we have $2\\pi r_A = 6$ so $r_A = 3/\\pi$ and $V_A = \\pi r_A ^2 h = \\pi (3/\\pi)^2 (8) = 72/\\pi$.\n\nBelinda's cylinder has a height of 6 and a base circumference of 8.  Similarly, let her cylinder have volume $V_B$ and radius $r_B$; we have $2\\pi r_B = 8$ so $r_B = 4/\\pi$ and $V_B = \\pi r_B^2 h = \\pi (4/\\pi)^2 (6) = 96/\\pi$.\n\nThe positive difference between the volume of the two tubes is $96/\\pi - 72/\\pi = 24/\\pi$ cubic inches; $\\pi$ times this difference is $\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of each cylindrical tube, we need to find the radius and the height of each cylinder.\n\nAmy's cylinder:\n\nWhen Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together, the circumference of the base of the cylinder is 8 inches. Since the circumference of a circle is given by $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius, we can find the radius:\n\n$2\\pi r = 8\\pi$\n$r = \\frac{8\\pi}{2\\pi}$\n$r = 4$\n\nThe radius of the cylinder is 4 inches. The height of the cylinder is 6 inches (the other dimension of the paper). The volume of a cylinder is given by $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. So the volume of Amy's cylinder is:\n\n$V_{Amy} = \\pi \\cdot 4^2 \\cdot 6 = 96\\pi$\n\nBelinda's cylinder:\n\nWhen Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together, the circumference of the base of the cylinder is 6 inches. Since the circumference of a circle is given by $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius, we can find the radius:\n\n$2\\pi r = 6\\pi$\n$r = \\frac{6\\pi}{2\\pi}$\n$r = 3$\n\nThe radius of the cylinder is 3 inches. The height of the cylinder is 8 inches (the other dimension of the paper). The volume of a cylinder is given by $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. So the volume of Belinda's cylinder is:\n\n$V_{Belinda} = \\pi \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 8 = 72\\pi$\n\nNow we need to find the positive difference between the two volumes:\n\n$V_{Amy} - V_{Belinda} = 96\\pi - 72\\pi$\n$V_{Amy} - V_{Belinda} = 24\\pi$\n\nFinally, we need to multiply this by $\\pi$:\n\n$\\pi \\cdot (V_{Amy} - V_{Belinda}) = \\pi \\cdot 24\\pi$\n$= 24\\pi^2$\n\nSo $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes is $24\\pi^2$."
