    "model_solution": "To find the length of $\\widehat{BC}$, we need to find the fraction of the circumference of the circle that $\\widehat{BC}$ represents.\n\nStep 1: Find the circumference of the entire circle.\nThe circumference of a circle is given by the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, but we are given the circumference as 60 feet. \n\nStep 2: Recognize that the central angle of $\\widehat{BC}$ is $60^{\\circ}$.\nThis is given in the problem.\n\nStep 3: Recall that the length of an arc is directly proportional to the central angle it subtends.\nIn particular, if the central angle is $\\theta$ (in degrees), the length of the arc is $\\frac{\\theta}{360}\\cdot C$, where $C$ is the circumference of the circle.\n\nStep 4: Apply this formula to find the length of $\\widehat{BC}$.\nThe central angle of $\\widehat{BC}$ is $60^{\\circ}$ and the circumference of the circle is 60 feet.\n\nStep 5: Substitute these values into the formula.\nLength of $\\widehat{BC} = \\frac{60}{360} \\cdot 60 = 10$ feet.\n\nTherefore, the length of $\\widehat{BC}$ is 10 feet."
