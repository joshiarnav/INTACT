    "model_solution": "To find the length of $\\overline{AD}$, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. $B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$, which means they divide it into three equal parts. Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, we can think of $M$ as the point that also divides $\\overline{AD}$ into two equal parts.\n\n2. Let the length of each of the three equal parts be $x$. Then, the length of $\\overline{AD}$ is $3x$.\n\n3. Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, we can say that $M$ divides $\\overline{AD}$ into two equal parts. One of these parts is $\\overline{AM}$, and the other is $\\overline{MD}$. Let the length of $\\overline{AM}$ be $y$.\n\n4. Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, we know that $y = \\frac{1}{2}AD$. But we also know that $AD = 3x$. Therefore, $y = \\frac{1}{2}(3x) = \\frac{3}{2}x$.\n\n5. But since we know that $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, and $M$ is also the point where $B$ and $C$ divide $\\overline{AD}$, we can conclude that $\\overline{AM}$ and $\\overline{MD}$ are each equal to one of the three parts of $\\overline{AD}$. Therefore, $y = x$.\n\n6. Now we have two expressions for $y$: $y = \\frac{3}{2}x$ and $y = x$. Setting these equal to each other, we get: $\\frac{3}{2}x = x$.\n\n7. To solve for $x$, we can multiply both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}$ to get $x = \\frac{2}{3}x$. But this doesn't make sense. Let's go back to the fact that $y = \\frac{3}{2}x$. We know $y$ is equal to $x$ because $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$ and also the point where $B$ and $C$ divide $\\overline{AD}$. However, we know that $\\overline{MC}$ is 8 units long and $\\overline{MC}$ is one of the three parts of $\\overline{AD}$.\n\n8. Since $y = x$ but $y$ is also equal to the length of $\\overline{AM}$ and $\\overline{MD}$ which are each one of the three parts of $\\overline{AD}$, we can say that the length of $\\overline{AM}$ and $\\overline{MD}$ is equal to the length of $\\overline{MC}$. Therefore, the length of $\\overline{AM}$ and $\\overline{MD}$ is 8 units.\n\n9. Since we know that the length of $\\overline{AM}$ and $\\overline{MD}$ is 8 units and $\\overline{M}$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, we can say that the length of $\\overline{AD}$ is twice the length of $\\overline{AM}$ or $\\overline{MD}$. Therefore, the length of $\\overline{AD}$ is $2 \\times 8 = 16$ units.\n\nSo, the length of $\\overline{AD}$ is 16 units."
