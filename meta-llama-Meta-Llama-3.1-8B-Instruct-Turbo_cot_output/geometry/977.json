    "problem": "The corner of a unit cube is chopped off such that the cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the vertex of the chosen corner.  What is the height of the remaining cube when the freshly-cut face is placed on a table?",
    "solution": "The major diagonal has a length of $\\sqrt{3}$.  The volume of the pyramid is $1/6$, and so its height $h$ satisfies $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot h\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(\\sqrt{2})^2=1/6$ since  the freshly cut face is an equilateral triangle of side length $\\sqrt{2}$.  Thus $h=\\sqrt{3}/3$, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. The unit cube has a side length of 1. This means that each edge of the cube has a length of 1 unit.\n2. We are cutting a corner off the cube, which means we are cutting off a tetrahedron (a three-dimensional pyramid with a triangular base). The three vertices we are cutting through are adjacent to one corner of the cube.\n3. Since the cube has a unit side length, the distance from the corner we are cutting to the opposite corner of the base of the tetrahedron is 1 unit (the length of the edge of the cube).\n4. The other two vertices of the base of the tetrahedron are also 1 unit away from the first vertex.\n5. Since the base of the tetrahedron is a triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the tetrahedron. The height of the tetrahedron is the distance from the third vertex (the apex) to the base.\n6. Since the three vertices are equally spaced on the surface of the cube, the height of the tetrahedron is the distance from the corner we are cutting to the center of the face of the cube.\n7. The distance from the corner of the cube to the center of the face of the cube is half the length of the face diagonal of the cube, which is \u221a2/\u221a3 or \u221a6/3 (via cross product) which can be computed via cross product and division, however this is also known to be sqrt(2)/2 multiplied by sqrt (3)/2 or just 1/2 * sqrt(6) via other means. \n8. Therefore, the height of the tetrahedron is 1/2 * sqrt(6)/2, which simplifies to sqrt(6)/4.\n9. The height of the remaining cube is equal to the height of the original cube minus the height of the tetrahedron.\n10. So, the height of the remaining cube is 1 - sqrt(6)/4.\n\nThe height of the remaining cube is 1 - sqrt(6)/4."
