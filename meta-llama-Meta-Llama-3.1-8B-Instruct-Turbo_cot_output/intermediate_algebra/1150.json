    "model_solution": "To find the monic quadratic polynomial in $x$ with real coefficients, which has $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$ as a root, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the complex conjugate**: Since the polynomial has real coefficients, and $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$ is a root, its complex conjugate, $-2 + i \\sqrt{5}$, must also be a root. The complex conjugate of a complex number $a + bi$ is $a - bi$.\n\n2. **Form the factors**: The factors of the polynomial are $(x - (-2 - i \\sqrt{5}))$ and $(x - (-2 + i \\sqrt{5}))$. We can simplify them to $(x + 2 + i \\sqrt{5})$ and $(x + 2 - i \\sqrt{5})$.\n\n3. **Multiply the factors**: To find the monic quadratic polynomial, we multiply the factors:\n   $(x + 2 + i \\sqrt{5})(x + 2 - i \\sqrt{5})$. Using the difference of squares identity $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$, we can simplify this product to $(x + 2)^2 - (i \\sqrt{5})^2$.\n\n4. **Simplify the expression**: Using the formula $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, we can expand $(x + 2)^2$ to $x^2 + 4x + 4$. Then, we can simplify $-(i \\sqrt{5})^2$ to $-(-5)$, which is $5$.\n\n5. **Combine the terms**: Combining the terms, we get $x^2 + 4x + 4 + 5 = x^2 + 4x + 9$.\n\nTherefore, the monic quadratic polynomial in $x$ with real coefficients, which has $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$ as a root, is $\\boxed{x^2 + 4x + 9}$."
