    "solution": "Note that $2^4 = 4^2,$ so from (iii), either $f(2) = 4$ or $f(4) = 2.$  But from (i),\n\\[f(4) > f(3) > f(2) > f(1),\\]so $f(4) \\ge 4.$   Hence, $f(2) = 4.$  By applying (ii) repeatedly, we find that\n\\[f(2^n) = 2^{2n}\\]for all positive integers $n.$\n\nFrom (i) and (iii),\n\\[f(3)^2 = f(9) > f(8) = 64,\\]so $f(3) \\ge 9.$\n\nSimilarly,\n\\[f(3)^8 = f(3^8) < f(2^{13}) = 2^{26},\\]so $f(3) \\le 9.$  Therefore, $f(3) = 9.$  It follows that $f(3^n) = 3^{2n}$ for all positive integers $n.$\n\nNow,\n\\[f(5)^3 = f(5^3) < f(2^7) = 2^{14},\\]so $f(5) \\le 25.$\n\nAlso,\n\\[f(5)^{11} = f(5^{11}) > f(3^{16}) = 3^{32},\\]so $f(5) \\ge 25.$  Therefore, $f(5) = 25.$\n\nHence,\n\\[f(30) = f(2) f(3) f(5) = 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 25 = \\boxed{900}.\\]Note that the function $f(n) = n^2$ satisfies all the given properties.

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of all possible values of $f(30)$, we need to find the values of $f(2)$ and $f(3)$ first, since $30 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.\n\nFrom condition (iii), we know that $f(2) = 4$ or $f(4) = 2$. But if $f(4) = 2$, then $f(2) \\cdot f(2) = f(4) = 2$, which is a contradiction. So, $f(2) = 4$.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $f(3)$. Let's assume $f(3) = 3k$ for some positive integer $k$. Then, using condition (ii), we have $f(3^2) = f(3) \\cdot f(3) = (3k)^2 = 9k^2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the inequality from condition (i): $f(n + 1) > f(n)$ for all positive integers $n$. For $n = 1$, we have $f(2) > f(1)$. Since $f(2) = 4$, we have $f(1) < 4$.\n\nFor $n = 2$, we have $f(3) > f(2)$. Since $f(3) = 3k$ and $f(2) = 4$, we have $3k > 4$.\n\nCombining these two inequalities, we have $3k > 4$ and $3k < 9k^2$. The only integer solution to these inequalities is $k = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $f(3) = 3k = 6$. Now, we need to find the value of $f(5)$.\n\nLet's assume $f(5) = 5m$ for some positive integer $m$. Then, using condition (ii), we have $f(5^2) = f(5) \\cdot f(5) = (5m)^2 = 25m^2$.\n\nAgain, let's consider the inequality from condition (i): $f(n + 1) > f(n)$ for all positive integers $n$. For $n = 3$, we have $f(4) > f(3)$. Since $f(4) = f(2) \\cdot f(2) = 16$ and $f(3) = 6$, we have $16 > 6$.\n\nFor $n = 4$, we have $f(5) > f(4)$. Since $f(5) = 5m$ and $f(4) = 16$, we have $5m > 16$.\n\nCombining these two inequalities, we have $5m > 16$. The smallest integer solution to this inequality is $m = 4$.\n\nTherefore, $f(5) = 5m = 20$. Now, we can find the value of $f(30)$.\n\nUsing condition (ii), we have $f(30) = f(2) \\cdot f(3) \\cdot f(5) = 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 20 = 480$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of $f(30)$ is $480$."
