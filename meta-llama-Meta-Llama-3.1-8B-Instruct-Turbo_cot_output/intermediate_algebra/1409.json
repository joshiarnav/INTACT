    "solution": "Let $y$ be a number in the range of $f.$ This means that there is a real number $x$ such that \\[y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $x^2-x+1$ and rearranging, we get the equation \\[yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0.\\]Since $x^2-x+1 = (x-\\tfrac12)^2 + \\tfrac34 > 0$ for all $x,$ our steps are reversible, so $y$ is in the range of $f$ if and only if this equation has a real solution for $x.$ In turn, this equation has a real solution for $x$ if and only if the discriminant of this quadratic is nonnegative. Therefore, the range of $f$ consists exactly of the values of $y$ which satisfy \\[(y+1)^2 - 4y^2 \\ge 0,\\]or \\[0 \\ge 3y^2 - 2y - 1.\\]This quadratic factors as \\[0 \\ge (3y+1)(y-1),\\]which means that the solutions to the inequality are given by $-\\tfrac13 \\le y \\le 1.$ Therefore, the range of $g$ is the closed interval $\\boxed{[-\\tfrac13, 1]}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the range of the function, we can start by assuming $y$ is in the range of $f$, and then find the values of $x$ that satisfy this condition.\n\nAssuming $y = f(x) = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$, we can multiply both sides by the denominator to get:\n\n\\[y(x^2-x+1) = x\\]\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n\\[yx^2-yx+y = x\\]\n\nRearranging the terms to form a quadratic equation in $x$, we get:\n\n\\[yx^2-(y+1)x+y = 0\\]\n\nSince $x$ can be any real number, the equation $yx^2-(y+1)x+y = 0$ should have a solution for any value of $x$. This means the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be greater than or equal to 0, which gives us:\n\n\\[(y+1)^2 - 4y^2 \\ge 0\\]\n\nExpanding the inequality and simplifying, we get:\n\n\\[y^2 + 2y + 1 - 4y^2 \\ge 0\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[-3y^2 + 2y + 1 \\ge 0\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic inequality. To solve it, we can factor the quadratic expression:\n\n\\[(-3y+1)(y+1) \\ge 0\\]\n\nNow we can find the intervals where the inequality is true.\n\nThe inequality will be true if either $(y-1/3)(y+1)$ is positive or both factors are zero. \n\nSince both factors cannot be zero at the same time, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for $y$:\n\n- For $y-1/3=0$, we have $y=1/3$.\n- For $y+1=0$, we have $y=-1$.\n\nSo the inequality will be true if $y \\in (-\\infty, -1) \\cup (1/3, \\infty)$.\n\nThis means that the range of the function is $(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (1/3, \\infty)$.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function is $\\boxed{(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (1/3, \\infty)}$."
