    "problem": "For which value of $x$ does the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}$ cross its horizontal asymptote?",
    "solution": "The horizontal asymptote of $f$ is the horizontal line that $f$ approaches as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. When the leading terms of the numerator and denominator have the same degree, that line is at the value equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients, namely $y = 2/1 = 2$. Setting this equal to $f(x)$, $$f(x) = 2 = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}.$$Clearing the denominator, $$2(x^2 - 4x + 1) = 2x^2 - 8x + 2 = 2x^2 - 5x - 7 \\Longrightarrow 3x = 9 \\Longrightarrow x = \\boxed{3}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To find where the function crosses its horizontal asymptote, we first need to determine the equation of the horizontal asymptote. \n\nThe horizontal asymptote of a rational function in the form of f(x) = P(x)/Q(x) (where P and Q are polynomials) is determined by the ratio of the leading coefficients of the polynomials P and Q, as x approaches infinity.\n\nIn this case, the leading coefficients are:\n- For P(x) = 2x^2 - 5x - 7, the leading coefficient is 2.\n- For Q(x) = x^2 - 4x + 1, the leading coefficient is 1.\n\nSo, the equation of the horizontal asymptote is y = 2/1 = 2.\n\nNext, we need to find the x-value at which the function f(x) crosses this horizontal asymptote. This means that we are looking for the x-value where f(x) = 2.\n\nWe can set up the equation by substituting the value of f(x) with 2:\n\n(2x^2 - 5x - 7)/(x^2 - 4x + 1) = 2\n\nTo solve this equation, we can cross-multiply to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2(x^2 - 4x + 1)\n\nExpanding the right-hand side of the equation gives:\n\n2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2x^2 - 8x + 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by subtracting 2x^2 from both sides and collecting like terms:\n\n-5x - 7 = -8x + 2\n\nAdding 8x to both sides gives:\n\n3x - 7 = 2\n\nAdding 7 to both sides gives:\n\n3x = 9\n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives:\n\nx = 3\n\nTherefore, the function f(x) crosses its horizontal asymptote when x = 3."
