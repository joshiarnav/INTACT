    "solution": "Because the foci both lie on the line $x=5$ and the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, the center must also lie on the line $x=5.$ However, we also know that the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center. Therefore, the center of the hyperbola lies on both the line $x=5$ and the line $y=3x,$ so its coordinates are $(5, 15).$\n\nBecause the hyperbola has a horizontal axis, the other asymptote must have slope $-3.$ Therefore, we can write a point-slope equation for the other asymptote: \\[y - 15 = -3(x - 5),\\]which is equivalent to $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the center of the hyperbola**: Since the foci have the same $x-$coordinate, which is $5$, the center of the hyperbola must lie on the vertical line $x=5$. The center will also be the midpoint of the line segment connecting the foci.\n\n2. **Find the midpoint between the foci**: Let's assume the center is at point $(5, y_0)$, where $y_0$ is the $y-$coordinate of the center. Since the center is the midpoint of the line segment connecting the foci, we can find the midpoint by averaging the $y-$coordinates of the foci.\n\nHowever, we do not have the $y-$coordinates of the foci. But we do know that the asymptotes intersect at the center of the hyperbola and since the center is on the vertical line $x = 5$,  we are looking for a point of the form $(5, y)$.\n\n3. **Find the other asymptote**: Since the given asymptote is $y = 3x$, the slope of this line is $3$. The slopes of the asymptotes of a hyperbola are negatives of each other. So, the slope of the other asymptote is $-3$.\n\nThe equation of the other asymptote will be of the form $y = -3x + b$. To find $b$, we can use the fact that the other asymptote passes through the center of the hyperbola.\n\n4. **Find the value of b**: Since the center of the hyperbola is on the line $x = 5$, we can find the $y-$coordinate of the center by plugging $x = 5$ into the equation of the given asymptote:\n\n$y = 3(5) = 15$.\n\nThe center is at point $(5, 15)$.\n\nNow we can plug $x = 5$ and $y = 15$ into the equation of the other asymptote to find $b$:\n\n$15 = -3(5) + b$\n\nSolving for $b$:\n\n$15 = -15 + b$\n\n$b = 15 + 15$\n\n$b = 30$\n\n5. **Find the equation of the other asymptote**: Now that we have found $b$, we can write the equation of the other asymptote:\n\n$y = -3x + 30$\n\nTherefore, the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola is $y = -3x + 30$."
