    "model_solution": "To find the distance between the foci, we first need to find the equation of the ellipse in standard form.\n\nGiven the equation of the ellipse: \n$16x^2 - 64x + y^2 + 4y + 4 = 0,$\n\nWe can start by completing the square for both x and y terms.\n\nFor x terms: \n$16(x^2 - 4x) = 16(x^2 - 4x + 4) - 64 = 16(x - 2)^2 - 64$\n\nFor y terms: \n$(y^2 + 4y) = (y^2 + 4y + 4) - 4 = (y + 2)^2 - 4$\n\nNow, substitute these back into the equation: \n$16(x - 2)^2 - 64 + (y + 2)^2 - 4 + 4 = 0$\n\nCombine like terms: \n$16(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 - 64 = 0$\n\nAdd 64 to both sides: \n$16(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 64$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in standard form: \n$\\frac{(x - 2)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y + 2)^2}{64} = 1$\n\nFrom the standard form of the equation, we can see that $a^2 = 64$ and $b^2 = 4$.\n\nTo find the distance between the foci, we need to find the value of c, which is given by: \n$c^2 = a^2 - b^2$\n\nSubstitute the values: \n$c^2 = 64 - 4 = 60$\n\n$c = \\sqrt{60} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 15} = 2\\sqrt{15}$\n\nThe distance between the foci is given by: \n$2c = 2 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{15} = 4\\sqrt{15}$\n\nTherefore, the distance between the foci is $4\\sqrt{15}$."
