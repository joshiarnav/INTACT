    "model_solution": "To find the mid-point of the line segment with end-points $-11 + 3i$ and $3 - 7i$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. We need to identify the coordinates of the two points. The first point is $-11 + 3i$, which means its real part is $-11$ and its imaginary part is $3$. The second point is $3 - 7i$, indicating that its real part is $3$ and its imaginary part is $-7$.\n\n2. To find the mid-point, we need to average the real parts and the imaginary parts of the two points separately.\n\n3. The average of the real parts $-11$ and $3$ can be found by adding the two numbers and dividing by $2$. So, the average real part is $\\frac{-11 + 3}{2}$.\n\n4. The average of the imaginary parts $3$ and $-7$ can be found by adding the two numbers and dividing by $2$. So, the average imaginary part is $\\frac{3 + (-7)}{2}$.\n\n5. Now we can calculate the average real and imaginary parts:\n   - The average real part is $\\frac{-11 + 3}{2} = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4$.\n   - The average imaginary part is $\\frac{3 + (-7)}{2} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2$.\n\n6. Therefore, the complex number corresponding to the mid-point of the line segment is $-4 - 2i$.\n\nThe final answer is $-4 - 2i$."
