    "problem": "If the seven-digit number $854n526$ is divisible by $11$, what is $n$?",
    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of n, we'll use the divisibility rule for 11. The rule states that a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11.\n\nFirst, let's identify the digits in the odd and even positions:\n\nOdd positions: 8, 4, n, 6\nEven positions: 5, 5, 2\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the digits in the odd and even positions:\n\nSum of odd positions: 8 + 4 + n + 6 = 18 + n\nSum of even positions: 5 + 5 + 2 = 12\n\nNext, we'll find the difference between the sum of the odd positions and the sum of the even positions:\n\nDifference: (18 + n) - 12 = 18 + n - 12 = 6 + n\n\nAccording to the divisibility rule for 11, the difference must be a multiple of 11. So, we need to find a value of n that makes 6 + n a multiple of 11.\n\nPossible multiples of 11: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 110\n\nWe can see that 6 + n = 55 is a multiple of 11. To find the value of n, we'll subtract 6 from 55:\n\nn = 55 - 6\nn = 49\n\nSo, the value of n is 49."
