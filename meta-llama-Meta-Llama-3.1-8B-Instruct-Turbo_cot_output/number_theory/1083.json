    "problem": "A positive number is called $n$-primable if it is divisible by $n$ and each of its digits is a one-digit prime number. How many 3-primable positive integers are there that are less than 1000?",
    "solution": "The one-digit prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7. A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So we want to count the number of ways we can pick three or fewer of these digits that add up to a multiple of 3 and form a number with them. We will use modular arithmetic. Of our allowable digits, $3 \\equiv 0$, $7 \\equiv 1$, $2\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, and $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. The ways to add up 3 or fewer numbers to get 0 modulo 3 are shown:\n\n1. 0\n\n2. 0 + 0\n\n3. 1 + 2\n\n4. 0 + 0 + 0\n\n5. 1 + 1 + 1\n\n6. 2 + 2 + 2\n\n7. 0 + 1 + 2\n\nWe will count the number of 3-primable integers each case produces:\n\n1. There is 1 number, 3.\n\n2. There is 1 number, 33.\n\n3. One of the digits is 7, and the other digit is either 2 or 5. So there are 2 choices for this digit, and once the digit is chosen, there are 2 ways to arrange the digits of the 3-primable number (for example, if we choose the digit 2, then we could either have 72 or 27). So there are $(2)(2) = 4$ numbers in this case.\n\n4. There is 1 number, 333.\n\n5. There is 1 number, 777.\n\n6. Each of the three digits is either 2 or 5. This gives $2^3 = 8$ numbers.\n\n7. One of the digits is 3, one of the digits is 7, and the other digit is either 2 or 5. Once we choose either 2 or 5, there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the digits of the 3-primable number. So there are $2(6) = 12$ numbers in this case.\n\nSo in total, our answer is $1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 12 = \\boxed{28}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of 3-primable positive integers less than 1000. This means we need to find the numbers that are divisible by 3 and have digits that are one-digit primes (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\nFirst, we need to consider the possible combinations of digits for a 3-digit number. Since the digits must be primes, we have 4 options for each digit (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\nHowever, not all combinations of these digits will result in a number that is divisible by 3. To be divisible by 3, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet's consider the possible sums of the digits that are divisible by 3:\n\n- The sum of the digits is 3: This is possible with the combination (2, 1, 0), but 1 is not a prime digit, so this is not a valid combination.\n- The sum of the digits is 6: This is possible with the combination (2, 2, 2), but this is not a valid combination because it repeats the same digit.\n- The sum of the digits is 9: This is possible with the combinations (3, 2, 4) and (4, 2, 3), but 4 is not a prime digit, so this is not a valid combination.\n- The sum of the digits is 12: This is possible with the combinations (2, 5, 5), (5, 2, 5), (5, 5, 2), (3, 3, 6), (6, 3, 3) and (3, 6, 3), but 4, 6 are not prime digits, so this is not a

digits is 18: This is possible with the combination (2, 7, 9) and (9, 7, 2), (7, 9, 2) and (2, 9, 7), but 9 is not a prime digit, so this is not a valid combination.\n- The sum of the digits is 21: This is possible with the combinations (3, 7, 11) and (11, 7, 3) and (7, 3, 11) and (3, 11, 7), but 11 is not a prime digit, so this is not a valid combination.\n- The sum of the digits is 24: This is possible with the combination (2, 11, 11) and (11, 2, 11) and (11, 11, 2), but 11 is not a prime digit, so this is not a valid combination.\n- The sum of the digits is 27: This is possible with the
