    "problem": "What is the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal?",
    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the $100$th digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide 3 by 26**: \n\nTo convert $\\frac{3}{26}$ into a decimal, we'll perform long division. \n\n2. **Perform the division**:\n\n   \\begin{array}{r}\n0.1\\\\\n\\hline\n&26\\\\\n&\\underline{26}\\\\\n&0\\\\\n\\hline\n&3\\\\\n&\\underline{26}\\\\\n&-23\\\\\n&0\\\\\n\\hline\n&3\\\\\n&\\underline{24}\\\\\n&7\\\\\n&0\\\\\n\\hline\n&0.1\\overline{15}\n\\end{array}\n\n   The result is $0.1\\overline{15}$, meaning the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$ has a repeating block of \"15\".\n\n3. **Determine the period length**:\n\nThe repeating block of \"15\" has a length of 2. This means that every 2 digits, the pattern repeats.\n\n4. **Find the position of the 100th digit**:\n\nWe need to find the position of the 100th digit after the decimal point. Since the repeating block has a length of 2, we can divide 100 by 2 and look at the remainder to determine which digit in the repeating block is the 100th digit.\n\n   $100 \\div 2 = 50$ with a remainder of 0.\n\n   Since the remainder is 0, it means the 100th digit is the last digit in the repeating block.\n\n   Therefore, the 100th digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$ is 5.\n\nThe final answer is 5."
