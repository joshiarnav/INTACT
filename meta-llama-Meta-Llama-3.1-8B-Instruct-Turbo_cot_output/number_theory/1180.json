    "problem": "What is the smallest number divisible by integers 1 through 9?",
    "solution": "To find the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we ignore 1 and prime factorize the rest to obtain $2, 3, 2^2, 5, 2\\cdot 3, 7, 2^3$, and $3^2$. Taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find that the least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{2520}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest number divisible by integers 1 through 9, we can start by finding the prime factors of each number and then combining them.\n\n1. 1: No prime factors\n2. 2: 2\n3. 3: 3\n4. 4: 2 * 2\n5. 5: 5\n6. 6: 2 * 3\n7. 7: 7\n8. 8: 2 * 2 * 2\n9. 9: 3 * 3\n\nNow, let's combine the prime factors:\n\n- To be divisible by 2, the number must have at least 2^3 (8) because 8 is the highest power of 2 in the numbers 1-9.\n- To be divisible by 3, the number must have at least 3^2 (9) because 9 is the highest power of 3 in the numbers 1-9.\n- To be divisible by 5, the number must have 5^1 (5) because 5 is not divisible by any other number in the numbers 1-9.\n- To be divisible by 7, the number must have 7^1 (7) because 7 is not divisible by any other number in the numbers 1-9.\n\nCombining the prime factors, we get 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^1 * 7^1 = 8 * 9 * 5 * 7 = 2520.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number divisible by integers 1 through 9 is 2520."
