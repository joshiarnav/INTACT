    "model_solution": "To find the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List all positive two-digit multiples of 7:**\n   The smallest two-digit multiple of 7 is 14 (7 * 2).\n   The largest two-digit multiple of 7 is 98 (7 * 14).\n\n   So, the multiples are: 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98.\n\n2. **Count the number of multiples:**\n   There are 14 multiples of 7 in the list (from 14 to 98 inclusive).\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the multiples:**\n   To calculate the sum, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n   sum = (n/2) * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\n   sum = (14/2) * (14 + 98)\n   sum = 7 * 112\n   sum = 784\n\n4. **Calculate the arithmetic mean:**\n   The arithmetic mean (or average) is calculated by dividing the sum of the multiples by the number of multiples:\n   mean = sum / n\n   mean = 784 / 14\n   mean = 56\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7 is 56."
