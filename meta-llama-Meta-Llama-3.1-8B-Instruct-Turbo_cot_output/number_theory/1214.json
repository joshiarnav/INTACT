    "solution": "Adding the first digits, we get $8$, hence $2$ after carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, again with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $2$, with carrying. Finally, adding $1$ to one, we get $2$. Thus our final answer is $\\boxed{22112_6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To add $2343_6+15325_6$, let's first convert both numbers to base 10 to make the calculation easier. \n\n$2343_6$ in base 10 can be calculated as follows:\n\n- $3 \\times 6^0 = 3$\n- $4 \\times 6^1 = 24$\n- $3 \\times 6^2 = 108$\n- $2 \\times 6^3 = 432$\n- $3 \\times 6^4 = 1458$\n\nAdding these values together: $3 + 24 + 108 + 432 + 1458 = 2025$\n\nSimilarly, $15325_6$ in base 10 can be calculated as follows:\n\n- $5 \\times 6^0 = 5$\n- $2 \\times 6^1 = 12$\n- $3 \\times 6^2 = 108$\n- $5 \\times 6^3 = 1080$\n- $1 \\times 6^4 = 1296$\n\nAdding these values together: $5 + 12 + 108 + 1080 + 1296 = 2501$\n\nNow, let's add the base 10 values: $2025 + 2501 = 4526$\n\nTo convert $4526$ back to base 6, we'll divide it by $6$ and keep track of the remainders:\n\n- $4526 \\div 6 = 753$ with remainder $0$\n- $753 \\div 6 = 125$ with remainder $3$\n- $125 \\div 6 = 20$ with remainder $5$\n- $20 \\div 6 = 3$ with remainder $2$\n- $3 \\div 6 = 0$ with remainder $3$\n\nNow, we'll write the remainders in reverse order: $32530_6$.\n\nTherefore, $2343_6+15325_6$ in base 6 is $32530_6$."
