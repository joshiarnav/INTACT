    "solution": "We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4. Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$. We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$. Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will need to find the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome when written in both base 2 and 4.\n\n**Step 1: Checking for Palindromes in Base 4**\n\nSince the number needs to be a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4, we can start by checking palindromes in base 4. \n\nThe smallest base-10 positive integers greater than 5 are: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc.\n\nWe can start by converting these numbers into base 4 and checking if they are palindromes.\n\n- 6 in base 4 is 12 (base 4), which is not a palindrome.\n- 7 in base 4 is 13 (base 4), which is not a palindrome.\n- 8 in base 4 is 22 (base 4), which is not a palindrome.\n- 9 in base 4 is 23 (base 4), which is not a palindrome.\n- 10 in base 4 is 22 (base 4), which is not a palindrome.\n- 11 in base 4 is 31 (base 4), which is not a palindrome.\n\nLet's move on to the next number.\n\n- 12 in base 4 is 32 (base 4), which is not a palindrome.\n- 13 in base 4 is 33 (base 4), which is a palindrome.\n\nHowever, we still need to check if this number is a palindrome in base 2.\n\n**Step 2: Checking for Palindromes in Base 2**\n\nNow, we need to convert the base-4 palindrome 33 to base 2 and check if it is a palindrome.\n\n33 in base 4 is equal to:\n\n3 * 4^1 + 3 * 4^0\n= 3 * 4 + 3 * 1\n= 12 + 3\n= 15\n\n15 in base 2 is 1111 (binary), which is a palindrome.\n\nSo, the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome when written in both base 2 and 4 is indeed 15.\n\nHowever, the problem seems to be more about the process to get the correct answer so the answer is not the only thing we are looking for."
