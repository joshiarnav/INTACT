    "problem": "Find the number of odd digits in the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$.",
    "solution": "We begin by converting $233_{10}$ into base-4. Since $4^3=64$ is the largest power of 4 that is less than 233, and $3\\cdot64=192$ is the largest multiple of 64 that is less than 233, the coefficient of the $4^3$ term will be 3. From here, we are left with a remainder of $233-192=41$. The largest power of 4 that is less than this number is $4^2=16$, and the largest multiple of 16 that is less than 41 is $2\\cdot16=32$. This leaves us with $41-32=9$, which we can express as $2\\cdot4^1+1\\cdot4^0$. So, we find that $233_{10}=3\\cdot4^3+2\\cdot4^2+2\\cdot{4^1}+1\\cdot4^0=3221_4$, which has $\\boxed{2}$ odd digits.",

    "model_solution": "To find the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$, we need to divide it by 4 and find the remainder. We'll do this step by step until the quotient is 0.\n\n1. $233 \\div 4 = 58$ with a remainder of 1.\n2. $58 \\div 4 = 14$ with a remainder of 2.\n3. $14 \\div 4 = 3$ with a remainder of 2.\n4. $3 \\div 4 = 0$ with a remainder of 3.\n\nNow, we can write the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$ as the sequence of remainders, starting from the last:\n\n$233_{10} = 3221_4$\n\nNow, we need to find the number of odd digits in the base-4 representation. In base-4, the odd digits are 1 and 3. In the base-4 representation 3221, there are 2 odd digits. \n\nSo, the number of odd digits in the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$ is 2."
