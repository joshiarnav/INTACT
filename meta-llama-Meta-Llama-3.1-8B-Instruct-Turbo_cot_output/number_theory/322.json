    "problem": "Find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.",
    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's consider the requirements for a three-digit number to be divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits. \n\n1. The number must be a three-digit number, so it must be greater than or equal to 100 and less than 1000.\n2. The number must be divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits. This means that if a digit appears more than once, the number will not satisfy the condition.\n3. We need to find the largest three-digit number that satisfies these conditions.\n\nLet's start with the largest possible three-digit number: 999. However, 999 is not divisible by 9, so we need to consider smaller numbers.\n\nFor the hundreds digit, we can start with the largest possible digit: 9. However, the number must also be divisible by the tens and ones digits, so we need to consider combinations of digits that are divisible by 9.\n\nSome possible combinations of digits that are divisible by 9 include:\n\n- 9, 9, x (not possible since x cannot be 0)\n- 9, 8, x (not possible since 9 is not divisible by 8 or vice versa)\n- 9, 7, x (not possible since 9 is not divisible by 7)\n- 9, 6, x (not possible since 9 is not divisible by 6)\n- 9, 5, x (not possible since 9 is not divisible by 5)\n- 9, 4, x (9 is not divisible by 4)\n- 9, 3, x (9 is not divisible by 3)\n- 9, 2, x (9 is not divisible by 2)\n- 9, 1, x (9 is not divisible by 1)\n\nHowever, 936 is not a solution since it does not meet the \"distinct\" condition.\n\nLet's consider the next largest possible hundreds digit: 8. However, the number must also be divisible by the tens and ones digits, so we need to consider combinations of digits that are divisible by 8.\n\nSome possible combinations of digits that are divisible by 8 include:\n\n- 8, 8, x (not possible since x cannot be 0)\n- 8, 7, x (not a combination)\n- 8, 6, x (8 is not divisible by 6)\n- 8, 5, x (8 is not divisible by 5)\n- 8, 4, x (a possible combination)\n- 8, 3, x (8 is not divisible by 3)\n- 8, 2, x (8 is divisible by 2)\n- 8, 1, x (8 is not divisible by 1)\n\nA possible combination is 8, 4, 8 is not possible since we cannot repeat a digit. So, we consider other options with 4, which is 864."
