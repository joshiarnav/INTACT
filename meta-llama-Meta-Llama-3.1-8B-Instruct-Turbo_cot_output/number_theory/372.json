    "problem": "A positive five-digit integer is in the form $AB,CBA$; where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are each distinct digits. What is the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven?",
    "solution": "We can test an integer for divisibility by $11$ by alternately adding and subtracting its digits.  For example, $8162$ is divisible by 11 because $8-1+6-2=11$ is divisible by 11.  In this case, $2A-2B+C$ must be divisible by 11.  If there are satisfactory values of $B$ and $C$ corresponding to $A=9$, then the resulting integer would be larger than any integer with $A<9$.  Therefore, we try $A=9$ first.  If $A=9$, then $C-2B+18$ must be divisible by $11$.  Equivalently, $C-2B$ equals $-7$ or $4$, which implies $C=2B-7$ or $C=2B+4$.  Wanting to make $B$ as large as possible, we try $B=9,8,7,\\ldots$. $B$ cannot be $9$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct.  If $B=8$, then $C=9$, so again the digits are not distinct.  If $B=7$, then $C=7$ and still the digits are not distinct.  If $B=6$, then $C=5$, and $AB,\\!CBA=\\boxed{96,\\!569}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the divisibility rule for 11**: A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the alternate digits from the left and the sum of the remaining alternate digits (from right to left) is either 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\nGiven the number $AB,CBA$:\n\n- The alternate digits from the left are $A$ and $C$, and their sum is $A + C$.\n- The remaining alternate digits are $B$ and $B$, and their sum is $2B$.\n\n2. **Apply the divisibility rule**: For the number to be divisible by 11, the difference between $A + C$ and $2B$ must be 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\n3. **Express the condition mathematically**: $A + C - 2B$ must be 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\n4. **Find the maximum value for A, B, and C**: To maximize $AB,CBA$, we need to start by maximizing A, then B, and finally C.\n\nSince $AB,CBA$ is a five-digit number, A cannot be 0. A maximum possible value for A is 9 (since the maximum value of a digit is 9).\n\n5. **Find the value of C**: After choosing A as 9, we need to find C such that the difference between $A + C$ and $2B$ is 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\n6. **Iterate over possible values of B**: Iterate over possible values of B, starting from 9 (the next largest digit) down to 1, and check for each value of B whether we can find a value of C that satisfies the divisibility rule.\n\nLet's start with B = 9. If B = 9, then we need $9 + C - 18 = 0$ or a multiple of 11, which is not possible since $C - 9$ is not a multiple of 11.\n\nNext, let B = 8. Then we need $9 + C - 16 = 0$ or a multiple of 11, which implies $C = 7$.\n\nSince A, B, and C are distinct digits, this is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven is 987,789."
