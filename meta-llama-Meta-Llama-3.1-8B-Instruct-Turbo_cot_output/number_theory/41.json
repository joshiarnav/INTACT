    "problem": "If $k$ and $\\ell$ are positive 4-digit integers such that $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$, what is the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$?",
    "solution": "The identity $\\gcd(k,\\ell)\\cdot\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell$ holds for all positive integers $k$ and $\\ell$. Thus, we have $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{3}.$$Also, $k$ and $\\ell$ must be 4-digit multiples of $3$, so our choices for each are $$1002,1005,1008,1011,1014,\\ldots,$$and by minimizing the product $k\\ell$, we minimize the least common multiple of $k$ and $\\ell$. However, $k$ and $\\ell$ cannot both be $1002$, since their greatest common divisor would then be $1002$ (not $3$). Setting $k=1002$ and $\\ell=1005$, we obtain $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$ as desired, and we obtain the smallest possible value for the least common multiple: \\begin{align*}\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005] &= \\frac{1002\\cdot 1005}{3} \\\\\n&= 1002\\cdot 335 \\\\\n&= (1000\\cdot 335)+(2\\cdot 335)\\\\\n&= \\boxed{335{,}670}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$, we need to consider the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. \n\nGiven that $k$ and $\\ell$ are positive 4-digit integers and $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$, we know that the only common factor of $k$ and $\\ell$ is 3. \n\nThe product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers $k$ and $\\ell$ is equal to the product of $k$ and $\\ell$: \n\n$$\\gcd(k,\\ell)\\cdot\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell.$$\n\nWe also know that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers. \n\nWe need to find the smallest possible values of $k$ and $\\ell$ that satisfy these conditions. \n\nSince $k$ and $\\ell$ are 4-digit integers, the smallest possible values for $k$ and $\\ell$ that are multiples of 3 are 1002 and 1005. \n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the GCD of $k$ and $\\ell$ is 3, not 3011 or 1002 or 1005. \n\nTo do this, we can choose the smallest prime number that is not a factor of 1002 or 1005, and multiply it by 3. \n\nThe smallest prime number that is not a factor of 1002 or 1005 is 7. \n\nSo, we can choose $k=3003$ and $\\ell=3006$. \n\nThe GCD of $k$ and $\\ell$ is 3, and they are both 4-digit integers.\n\nNow we can find the LCM of $k$ and $\\ell$ using the formula: \n\n$$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{\\gcd(k,\\ell)}.$$\n\nSubstituting the values of $k$, $\\ell$, and $\\gcd(k,\\ell)$, we get:\n\n$$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3003,3006] = \\frac{3003\\cdot 3006}{3} = 3003000.$$\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value for the LCM of $k$ and $\\ell$ is 3003000."
