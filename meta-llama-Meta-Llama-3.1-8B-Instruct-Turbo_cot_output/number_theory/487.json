    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the value of x modulo 20.\n\nGiven equations: \n1) $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$\n2) $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$\n\nWe can simplify equation 1 by dividing both sides by 4 and reducing modulo 20. However, in this case, we can simplify the equation as follows:\n$4x-8 = 20k$ (for some integer k)\nDividing both sides by 4:\n$x-2 = 5k$\nTherefore,\n$x = 2+5k$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into equation 2:\n$3(2+5k)\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$\n$6+15k\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$\n$15k\\equiv 10\\pmod{20}$\n\nNow we can simplify this by dividing both sides by 5 and reducing modulo 20:\n$3k\\equiv 2\\pmod{4}$\n\nHowever, this approach can get complicated. Instead, notice that we can eliminate the 5 from the equation by multiplying both sides of the congruence by 3:\n$15k\\equiv 10\\pmod{20}$\n$45k\\equiv 30\\pmod{20}$\n$5k\\equiv 10\\pmod{20}$\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n$k \\equiv 2\\pmod{4}$\n\nSubstitute this value for k back into the expression for x:\n$x = 2+5k$\n$x = 2+5(2+4m)$ (for some integer m)\n$x = 2+10+20m$ (for some integer m)\n$x = 12+20m$\n\nNow, we have a general expression for x:\n$x \\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$\n\nTo find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by 20, we need to find the remainder when $(12+20m)^2$ is divided by 20.\n\nExpanding the square:\n$x^2 = (12+20m)^2$\n$x^2 = 144 + 480m + 400m^2$\n\nNow, divide this by 20:\n$x^2 \\equiv 4 + 24m\\pmod{20}$\n\nHowever, as we can see, $x^2 \\equiv 4\\pmod{20}$, which is a constant. The remainder is 4."
