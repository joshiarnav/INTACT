    "problem": "When $\\frac{3}{1250}$ is written as a decimal, how many zeros are there between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit?",
    "solution": "Rather than doing long division, we will write the given fraction to have a denominator of the form $10^b=2^b \\cdot 5^b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. First, we write $\\dfrac{3}{1250}$ as $\\dfrac{3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^4}$. To make the denominator fit the form $2^b \\cdot 5^b$, we make $b$ the larger of the two exponents, which in this case is $4$. Thus, we have $$\\frac{3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^1} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3}=\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^4} = \\frac{24}{10^4}$$The exponent in the denominator is $4$, and $24$ are the last two digits. Therefore, there are $4-2=\\boxed{2}$ zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.",

    "model_solution": "To convert $\\frac{3}{1250}$ to a decimal, we can start by simplifying the fraction. \n\nFirst, let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3 and 1250. The GCD of 3 and 1250 is 1, since they have no common factors other than 1.\n\nThis means $\\frac{3}{1250}$ is already in its simplest form.\n\nNow, to convert this fraction to a decimal, we can divide the numerator (3) by the denominator (1250).\n\nHowever, to make the division easier, we can express 1250 as $2^1 \\cdot 5^4$. \n\nThis can be rewritten as $2^1 \\cdot 5^4 = 5^4 \\cdot 2^1 = 5^4 \\cdot 2^1$  because we have no 2's in the numerator.\n\nThis simplifies our fraction to $\\frac{3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^4}$.\n\nSince we're looking for the number of zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit, we can rewrite the fraction as $\\frac{3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^4} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 5^3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^4} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 5^3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^1}$\n\nNow, we can simplify this fraction by canceling out $5^3$ from the numerator and $5^4$ from the denominator.\n\nThis leaves us with $\\frac{3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^1}$.\n\nNow, we can express the fraction as a decimal by dividing the numerator (3) by the denominator ($2^1 \\cdot 5^1$).\n\nHowever, we can rewrite the denominator as $10^1$ since $10^1 = 2^1 \\cdot 5^1$.\n\nThis gives us $\\frac{3}{10^1}$.\n\nSince dividing by $10^1$ is equivalent to moving the decimal point one place to the left, we can express the fraction as 0.3.\n\nTherefore, there is 1 zero between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit."
