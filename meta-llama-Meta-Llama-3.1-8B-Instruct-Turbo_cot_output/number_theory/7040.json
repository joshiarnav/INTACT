    "problem": "Call a positive integer $N$ a 7-10 double if the digits of the base-$7$ representation of $N$ form a base-$10$ number that is twice $N$. For example, $51$ is a 7-10 double because its base-$7$ representation is $102$. What is the largest 7-10 double?\n",
    "solution": "We let $N_7 = \\overline{a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0}_7$; we are given that\n\\[2(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_7 = (a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_{10}\\](This is because the digits in $N$ ' s base 7 representation make a number with the same digits in base 10 when multiplied by 2)\nExpanding, we find that\n\\[2 \\cdot 7^n a_n + 2 \\cdot 7^{n-1} a_{n-1} + \\cdots + 2a_0 = 10^na_n + 10^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0\\]\nor re-arranging,\n\\[a_0 + 4a_1 = 2a_2 + 314a_3 + \\cdots + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n\\]\nSince the $a_i$s are base-$7$ digits, it follows that $a_i < 7$, and the LHS is less than or equal to $30$. Hence our number can have at most $3$ digits in base-$7$. Letting $a_2 = 6$, we find that $630_7 = \\boxed{315}_{10}$ is our largest 7-10 double.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest 7-10 double, let's first consider how to represent a number in base-7 and base-10.\n\nIn base-7, the largest digit is 6. So, the largest base-7 number with a single digit is 6.\n\nNow, let's consider a 2-digit base-7 number, which is in the form of $ab_7$. Here, $a$ and $b$ are digits in base-7, ranging from 0 to 6.\n\nTo convert this base-7 number to base-10, we use the formula:\n$N = a \\times 7^1 + b \\times 7^0$.\n$N = 7a + b$.\n\nNow, let's consider the base-10 number formed by the digits of the base-7 representation. This number is $10a + b$.\n\nAccording to the problem, the base-10 number is twice the base-7 number, so we have $10a + b = 2(7a + b)$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n$10a + b = 14a + 2b$\n\nNow, let's isolate the variable $b$:\n$b = 14a - 10a$\n$b = 4a$\n\nSince $b$ is a digit in base-7, it can have values ranging from 0 to 6. However, since $b = 4a$, we can see that $b$ will always be a multiple of 4.\n\nThe largest multiple of 4 that is less than or equal to 6 is 4. So, the largest value of $b$ is 4.\n\nNow, let's substitute $b = 4$ into the equation $b = 4a$ to find the value of $a$:\n$4 = 4a$\n$a = 1$\n\nNow, let's substitute $a = 1$ and $b = 4$ into the base-7 number $ab_7$ to find the largest 7-10 double:\n$N = 14_7$\n$N = 1 \\times 7^1 + 4 \\times 7^0$\n$N = 7 + 4$\n$N = 11$\n\nHowever, we need to convert 11 base 10 to base 7. So, \n\n14 in base 7 is 11 in base 10"
