    "model_solution": "To find the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k,$ we need to determine the number of times 3 appears as a factor in the product of the first 100 positive odd integers.\n\nFirst, let's find the formula for the product of the first n positive odd integers. The product of the first n positive odd integers is given by:\n\n$$1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdots(2n-1)=\\frac{(2n-1)!}{2^{n-1}\\cdot n!}$$\n\nIn our case, we have $n=100,$ so:\n\n$$P=\\frac{(2\\cdot 100-1)!}{2^{100-1}\\cdot 100!}=\\frac{199!}{2^{99}\\cdot 100!}$$\n\nTo count the number of times 3 appears as a factor in $P,$ we only need to count the number of times 3 appears as a factor in $199!$ since we are dividing by $2^{99}\\cdot 100!.$ We will use the fact that the number of times a prime $p$ appears as a factor in $n!$ is given by:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{p^i}\\right\\rfloor$$\n\nwhere $\\lfloor\\cdot\\rfloor$ denotes the floor function.\n\nLet's count the number of times 3 appears as a factor in $199!$:\n\n$$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{199}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{199}{3^2}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{199}{3^3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{199}{3^4}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{199}{3^5}\\right\\rfloor$$\n\n$$=66+22+7+2+0=97$$\n\nHowever, we also need to count the number of times 3 appears as a factor in $100!.$ We do this by:\n\n$$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{100}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{100}{3^2}\\right\\rfloor=33+11=44$$\n\nSubtracting this from 97, we get:\n\n$$97-44=53$$\n\nTherefore, the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$ is 53."
