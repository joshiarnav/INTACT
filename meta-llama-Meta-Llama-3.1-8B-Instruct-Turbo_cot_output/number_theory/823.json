    "problem": "Kaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27, we first need to identify all clever integers. \n\nA clever integer must satisfy the given conditions:\n1. It is an even integer.\n2. It is greater than 20 and less than 120.\n3. The sum of its digits is 9.\n\nLet's start by listing out possible two-digit clever integers:\n- The sum of the digits is 9: (0 + 9), (1 + 8), (2 + 7), (3 + 6), (4 + 5), (5 + 4), (6 + 3), (7 + 2), (8 + 1), (9 + 0).\n- However, the hundreds place can't be 0, so we exclude (0 + 9).\n\nSo the possible two-digit clever integers are: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 98.\n\nNext, we filter the list to only include even numbers: 27, 36, 54, 72, 90, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 98.\n\nNow we need to check if the numbers are between 20 and 120: all 13 numbers are within the range.\n\nNext, we need to determine which clever integers are divisible by 27. \n\nTo be divisible by 27, the number must be divisible by both 3 and 9 (since 27 = 3 * 9). \n\nFrom our list, we see that 27, 54, 81, and 108 are divisible by 3. \n\nHowever, 27 and 54 are the only numbers on the list that are also divisible by 9.\n\nAlso, 27 and 54 are the only numbers on the list that meet all three conditions (even, between 20 and 120, and sum of digits is 9) and are divisible by 27.\n\nThe total number of clever integers is 13, and 2 of them are divisible by 27.\n\nSo the fraction of all clever integers that is divisible by 27 is 2/13."
