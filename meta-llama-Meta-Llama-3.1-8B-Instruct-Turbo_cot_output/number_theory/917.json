    "model_solution": "To find $2^{-1} \\pmod{185}$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 185. This is a number $x$ such that $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$.\n\nOne way to find this inverse is by using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. However, in this case, we can simplify the process by noticing that 185 is a multiple of 5 (185 = 37 * 5).\n\nSince 185 is a multiple of 5, we can reduce the problem to finding the inverse of 2 modulo 5. However, 2 has an inverse modulo 5, which is 3. This is because $2 * 3 = 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nNow, we need to find a number $a$ such that $2a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$ and $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. \n\nWe can use this congruence to find a solution by considering numbers of the form $a = 5k + 3$, where $k$ is an integer. We want to find a value of $k$ such that $2(5k + 3) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$.\n\nExpanding the expression, we get $10k + 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$. We can simplify this expression by subtracting 6 from both sides, which gives us $10k \\equiv -5 \\pmod{185}$.\n\nSince 185 is a multiple of 5, we can simplify this expression by dividing both sides by 5, which gives us $2k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{37}$. \n\nNow, we need to find a number $k$ such that $2k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{37}$. This is equivalent to finding a number $k$ such that $2k \\equiv 36 \\pmod{37}$.\n\nWe can solve this equation by inspection. Since 2 and 37 are relatively prime, we know that there exists a unique solution modulo 37. Moreover, the solution can be found by inspection.\n\nOne solution is $k \\equiv 18 \\pmod{37}$. \n\nNow, we can use this solution to find the value of $a$. Recall that $a = 5k + 3$. Substituting $k \\equiv 18 \\pmod{37}$, we get $a \\equiv 5(18) + 3 \\equiv 93 \\pmod{185}$.\n\nTherefore, we have found that $2^{-1} \\equiv 93 \\pmod{185}$."
