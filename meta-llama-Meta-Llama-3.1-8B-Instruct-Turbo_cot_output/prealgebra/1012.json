    "model_solution": "To express $0.\\overline{3}+0.\\overline{2}$ as a common fraction, we can break it down into steps.\n\n**Step 1: Convert repeating decimals to fractions**\n\n$0.\\overline{3}$ can be written as a fraction by letting $x = 0.\\overline{3}$. Then multiply both sides by 10 to get $10x = 3.\\overline{3}$. Subtracting the original equation from this new one gives $9x = 3$, which implies $x = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSimilarly, for $0.\\overline{2}$, let $y = 0.\\overline{2}$. Then $10y = 2.\\overline{2}$. Subtracting the original equation from this new one gives $9y = 2$, which implies $y = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n\n**Step 2: Add the fractions**\n\nNow that we have $0.\\overline{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $0.\\overline{2} = \\frac{2}{9}$, we can add them together:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}$$\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 9 in this case. We can rewrite $\\frac{1}{3}$ as $\\frac{1 \\cdot 3}{3 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{3}{9}$. Now we can add:\n\n$$\\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{3 + 2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\n\nTherefore, $0.\\overline{3}+0.\\overline{2} = \\frac{5}{9}$."
