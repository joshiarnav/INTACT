    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll use combinatorics. Since the chairs and stools are indistinguishable within their respective groups, we only need to consider the total number of arrangements.\n\nThere are 10 total spaces to fill with the 2 stools, and the remaining 8 spaces will be filled with the rocking chairs. The order of the spaces doesn't matter, as long as the stools and chairs occupy the correct spaces.\n\nWe can think of this as choosing 2 spaces out of 10 for the stools. The remaining spaces will automatically be filled with the rocking chairs. \n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 spaces out of 10 can be calculated using combinations. The formula for combinations is:\n\nnCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nFor this problem, n = 10 (total spaces) and k = 2 (spaces for the stools). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n10C2 = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n= 10! / (2!8!)\n= (10*9) / (2*1)\n= 45\n\nTherefore, there are 45 distinct ways to arrange the eight rocking chairs and two stools for a meeting."
