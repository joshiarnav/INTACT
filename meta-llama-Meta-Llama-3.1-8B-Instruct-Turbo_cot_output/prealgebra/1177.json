    "problem": "In a right triangle with integer length sides, the hypotenuse has length 39 units. How many units is the length of the shorter leg?",
    "solution": "Since they only ask for one length, you can assume that there's only one possible triangle.  Then, quickly note that $39 = 3\\cdot 13$, and that 5 - 12 - 13 is a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the shorter leg has length $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll use the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b):\n\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nWe know that the hypotenuse (c) has a length of 39 units. So, we can plug that value into the equation:\n\n39\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nFirst, let's calculate the square of 39:\n\n39\u00b2 = 1521\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n1521 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nNow, we need to find two perfect squares that add up to 1521. To do this, we can start by listing the perfect squares less than 1521:\n\n1\u00b2 = 1\n2\u00b2 = 4\n3\u00b2 = 9\n4\u00b2 = 16\n5\u00b2 = 25\n6\u00b2 = 36\n7\u00b2 = 49\n8\u00b2 = 64\n9\u00b2 = 81\n10\u00b2 = 100\n11\u00b2 = 121\n12\u00b2 = 144\n13\u00b2 = 169\n14\u00b2 = 196\n15\u00b2 = 225\n16\u00b2 = 256\n17\u00b2 = 289\n18\u00b2 = 324\n19\u00b2 = 361\n20\u00b2 = 400\n21\u00b2 = 441\n22\u00b2 = 484\n23\u00b2 = 529\n24\u00b2 = 576\n25\u00b2 = 625\n26\u00b2 = 676\n27\u00b2 = 729\n28\u00b2 = 784\n29\u00b2 = 841\n30\u00b2 = 900\n31\u00b2 = 961\n32\u00b2 = 1024\n33\u00b2 = 1089\n34\u00b2 = 1156\n35\u00b2 = 1225\n36\u00b2 = 1296\n37\u00b2 = 1369\n38\u00b2 = 1444\n39\u00b2 = 1521\n\nAs we can see, 36\u00b2 = 1296 and 37\u00b2 = 1369 are the two perfect squares that add up to 1521. However, we have 1521 = 37\u00b2 + 36\u00b2 which doesn't make the pair for a  and b. Therefore we need to think in another way.\n\nAnother pair of squares is 25\u00b2 + 38\u00b2 = 1225 + 1444 = 2670 \u2260 1521. But what if we have two squares that sum up to 1521 and are \"close\" to each other. From the squares above, we see that 36\u00b2 = 1296 and 25\u00b2 = 625 have a difference of 1296 - 625 = 671, which is close to the square root of 1521, which is approximately 39. We also see that 36 and 25 are close. Therefore, let's check the squares of numbers that are close to these numbers.\n\nLet's try numbers between 25 and 36. \n\nIf we try 35\u00b2 and 17\u00b2 we have 1225 and 289 which add up to 1514."
