    "model_solution": "To find the percent of $x$ that is equal to $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find $50\\%$ of $x$. \n   To do this, we multiply $x$ by $0.5$ (since $50\\% = 0.5$).\n   So, $50\\%$ of $x$ is $0.5x$.\n\n2. Next, we need to find $40\\%$ of $0.5x$. \n   To do this, we multiply $0.5x$ by $0.4$ (since $40\\% = 0.4$).\n   So, $40\\%$ of $0.5x$ is $0.4 \\times 0.5x = 0.2x$.\n\nNow, we need to find the percent of $x$ that is equal to $0.2x$. \n\nTo do this, we can divide $0.2x$ by $x$, and then multiply by $100\\%$ to get the percentage. \n\nDividing $0.2x$ by $x$ cancels out the $x$, leaving us with $0.2$.\n\nThen, multiplying $0.2$ by $100\\%$ gives us $20\\%$.\n\nTherefore, $20\\%$ of $x$ is equal to $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$."
