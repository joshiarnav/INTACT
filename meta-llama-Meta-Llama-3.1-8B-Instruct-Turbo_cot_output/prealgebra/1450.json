    "problem": "What is the product of $\\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{3}{7}$ ?",
    "solution": "A product is what you get when you multiply things together. To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator. So, the numerator is $1\\times3=3$.\n\nThen, multiply the denominators together to get the new denominator. $5\\times7 = 35$. Therefore our answer is:  \\[\\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{35}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the product of $\\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{3}{7}$, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the fractions**: We have two fractions: $\\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{3}{7}$.\n\n2. **Multiply the numerators**: The numerators are the numbers on top of the fractions. To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators together. So, we multiply $1$ and $3$.\n\n   $1 \\cdot 3 = 3$\n\n3. **Multiply the denominators**: The denominators are the numbers on the bottom of the fractions. To multiply fractions, we multiply the denominators together. So, we multiply $5$ and $7$.\n\n   $5 \\cdot 7 = 35$\n\n4. **Write the product as a fraction**: Now, we write the product of the numerators (the result of step 2) as the new numerator, and the product of the denominators (the result of step 3) as the new denominator.\n\n   $\\frac{3}{35}$\n\nSo, the product of $\\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{3}{7}$ is $\\frac{3}{35}$."
