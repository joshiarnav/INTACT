    "problem": "How many integers between 1 and 200 are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7?",
    "solution": "Integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 must be multiples of 15.  We can start by listing the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200: $$15,30,45,60,75,90,105,120,135,150,165,180,195$$ Checking only the even numbers, we can eliminate those that are multiples of 4, leaving us with: $$15,30,45,75,90,105,135,150,165,195$$ Finally, we need to eliminate any remaining multiples of 7.  The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0.  The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105.  Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\\boxed{9}$ integers.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of both 3 and 5, we need to find the number of multiples of their least common multiple (LCM). \n\nThe LCM of 3 and 5 is 15. \n\nSo, we need to find the number of multiples of 15 between 1 and 200. \n\nTo do this, we'll divide 200 by 15 and take the floor of the result (i.e., round down to the nearest whole number). \n\n200 / 15 \u2248 13.33 \n\nSo, the number of multiples of 15 between 1 and 200 is 13.\n\nHowever, we also need to exclude multiples of 4 and 7 from this count. \n\nThe LCM of 15 and 4 is 60, and the LCM of 15 and 7 is 105. \n\nFirst, let's find the number of multiples of 60 between 1 and 200 that are also multiples of 15 (i.e., multiples of 60 that are divisible by 15). \n\nWe'll divide 200 by 60 and take the floor of the result. \n\n200 / 60 \u2248 3.33 \n\nSo, the number of multiples of 60 between 1 and 200 that are also multiples of 15 is 3.\n\nNext, let's find the number of multiples of 105 between 1 and 200 that are also multiples of 15. \n\nWe'll divide 200 by 105 and take the floor of the result. \n\n200 / 105 \u2248 1.90 \n\nSo, the number of multiples of 105 between 1 and 200 that are also multiples of 15 is 1.\n\nNow, we'll subtract the number of multiples of 60 and 105 from the total number of multiples of 15. \n\nHowever, this would be incorrect because we would be double-counting multiples of 60 and 105. \n\nTo correctly do this, we would need to find the number of multiples of 60 and 105, and then add those back in once because they are multiples of both 60 and 105. \n\nThe LCM of 60 and 105 is 420, which is greater than 200. \n\nSo, we don't need to worry about this case. \n\nNow, let's find the number of multiples of 60 and 105 between 1 and 200. \n\nFirst, let's find the number of multiples of 60 between 1 and 200. \n\nWe'll divide 200 by 60 and take the floor of the result. \n\n200 / 60 \u2248 3.33 \n\nSo, the number of multiples of 60 between 1 and 200 is 3.\n\nNext, let's find the number of multiples of 105 between 1 and 200. \n\nWe'll divide 200 by 105 and take the floor of the result. \n\n200 / 105 \u2248 1.90 \n\nSo, the number of multiples of 105 between 1 and 200 is 1.\n\nNow that we have the number of multiples of 60 and 105, we can add them back in once because they are multiples of both 60 and 105. \n\nSo, the total number of multiples of 60 and 105 is 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nNow that we have the number of multiples of 60 and 105, we can subtract them from the total number of multiples of 15 and then add back in the number of multiples of 60 and 105. \n\nSo, the total number of integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7 is: \n\n13 - 4 + 0 = 9"
