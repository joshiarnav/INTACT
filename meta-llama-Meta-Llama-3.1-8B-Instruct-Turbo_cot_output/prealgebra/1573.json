    "problem": "A 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only six slices have pepperoni, and exactly ten slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
    "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 6 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number of the slices that have both toppings, so there are $6-n$ with just pepperoni and $10-n$ with just mushrooms.  Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices, we must have $(6-n) + (10-n) + n = 12$, which gives $n=\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of slides with both pepperoni and mushrooms, let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. Total number of slices: 12\n2. Number of slices with pepperoni: 6\n3. Number of slices with mushrooms: 10\n4. Since every slice has at least one topping, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of slices:\n   - Total slices = (slices with pepperoni) + (slices with mushrooms) - (slices with both)\n   - 12 = 6 + 10 - (slices with both)\n\nNow, we can solve for the slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms:\n\n- 12 = 16 - (slices with both)\n- (slices with both) = 16 - 12\n- (slices with both) = 4\n\nTherefore, 4 slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms."
