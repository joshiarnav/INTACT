    "problem": "Angela has $a$ marbles, Brian has twice as many marbles as Angela, Caden has three times as many marbles as Brian, and Daryl has five times the number of marbles Caden has. If in total Angela, Brian, Caden and Daryl have 78 marbles, what is the value of $a?$",
    "solution": "First, quantify the number of marbles each person has:\n\n$\\bullet$ Angela has $a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Brian has $2\\times a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Caden has $3\\times(2\\times a)$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Daryl has $5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles.\n\nIn total, the four people have $a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles. And that expression equals 78, since in total the four people have 78 marbles. Now evaluate the resulting equation. \\begin{align*}\n78&=a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+3(2a)+5(3(2a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+5(6a)\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+30a\\\\\n&=39a \\quad\\implies\\\\\na&=\\boxed{2}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $a$, let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. Brian has twice as many marbles as Angela. This means Brian has $2a$ marbles.\n\n2. Caden has three times as many marbles as Brian. Since Brian has $2a$ marbles, Caden has $3 \\times 2a = 6a$ marbles.\n\n3. Daryl has five times the number of marbles Caden has. Since Caden has $6a$ marbles, Daryl has $5 \\times 6a = 30a$ marbles.\n\n4. The total number of marbles Angela, Brian, Caden, and Daryl have is 78. This means the sum of their marbles is $a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 39a$. \n\n5. Since we know that the total number of marbles is 78, we can set up an equation: $39a = 78$.\n\n6. To solve for $a$, we divide both sides of the equation by 39: $a = \\frac{78}{39} = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is 2."
