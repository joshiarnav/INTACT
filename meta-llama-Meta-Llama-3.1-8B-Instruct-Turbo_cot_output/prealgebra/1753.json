    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem states that for any right-angled triangle with sides of length a, b, and the hypotenuse of length c, the following equation holds:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nIn this problem, we have a right-angled triangle $EAB$ with $BE=9$ units. We need to find the sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$.\n\nFirst, let's find the lengths of the sides $AB$ and $AE$. Let's denote the length of side $AB$ as $x$ and the length of side $AE$ as $y$. \n\nSince the angle $EAB$ is a right angle, we can apply the Pythagorean Theorem:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 9^2\n\nNow, we need to find the areas of the squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$. The area of a square is equal to the square of its side length. \n\nThe area of square $ABCD$ is x^2 and the area of square $AEFG$ is y^2.\n\nThe sum of the areas of the two squares is x^2 + y^2.\n\nWe already know that x^2 + y^2 = 9^2. So, the sum of the areas of the two squares is 9^2.\n\n9^2 = 81\n\nTherefore, the number of square units in the sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$ is 81."
