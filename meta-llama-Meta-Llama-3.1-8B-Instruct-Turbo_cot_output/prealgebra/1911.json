Since each point in the lattice is one unit from its nearest neighbor, all the equilateral triangles must have a side length of 1 unit.\n\nNow, let's look at the lattice and identify the possible equilateral triangles with a side length of 1 unit.\n\n1. Start with the central point (origin). The neighboring points (at coordinates (0,1), (1,0), and (-1,0)) form one equilateral triangle.\n2. The points at (1,0) and (-1,0) along with the point (0,1) and the point (1,1) form another equilateral triangle.\n3. Similarly, the points at (1,0) and (0,1) along with the point (1,1) and the point (1,2) form another equilateral triangle but since (1,2) is not adjacent to the points (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), the triangle (1,0), (0,1), (1,2) is not valid.\n\n4. The points at (-1,0) and (0,1) along with the point (1,1) and the point (1,0) form another equilateral triangle but since (1,0) is already adjacent to the points (1,1), (-1,0), and (0,1), we cannot use it as a vertex in this triangle. \n\n5. Similarly, the points at (1,0) and (1,1) along with the point (1,-1), (0,1), and the point (0,0) form another equilateral triangle but since (0,0) is not adjacent to the points (0,1), the triangle (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) is not valid.\n\n6. The points at (1,0) and (1,1) along with the point (1,-1) and the point (0,1) form another equilateral triangle but since (1,-1) is not adjacent to the points (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), the triangle (1,0), (1,-1), (1,1) is not valid.\n\n7. Similarly, the points at (-1,0) and (0,1) along with the point (0,-1) and the point (1,1) form another equilateral triangle but since (0,-1) is not adjacent to the points (1,1), (-1,0), (0,1), the triangle (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1) is not valid.\n\n8. The points at (-1,0) and (0,1) along with the point (1,1) and the point (-1,1) form another equilateral triangle but since (-1,1) is not adjacent to the points (1,1), (0,1), (-1,0), the triangle (-1,0), (0,1), (-1,1) is not valid.\n\n9. Similarly, the points at (1,0) and (0,1) along with the point (1,1) and the point (0,2) form another equilateral triangle but since (0,2) is not adjacent to the points (0,1), the triangle (0,2), (0,1), (1,0) is not valid.\n\n10. The points at (1,0) and (1,1) along with the point (1,-1), (0,1), and the point (2,0) form another equilateral triangle but since (2,0) is not adjacent to the points (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), the triangle (2,0), (1,0), (1,1) is not valid.\n\n11.

The points at (-1,0) and (0,1) along with the point (0,-1) and the point (-1,1) form another equilateral triangle but since (-1,1) is not adjacent to the points (0,-1), (0,1), (-1,0), the triangle (-1,0), (0,1), (-1,1) is not valid.\n\n13. Similarly, the points at (1,0) and (0,1) along with the point (1,1) and the point (0,-2) form another equilateral triangle but since (0,-2) is not adjacent to the points (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), the triangle (1,0), (1,1), (0,-2) is not valid.\n\n14. The points at (1,0) and (1,1) along with the point (1,-1) and the point (2,0) form another equilateral triangle but since (2,0) is not adjacent to the points (1,-1), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), the triangle (1,0), (1,-1), (2,0) is not valid.\n\n15. Similarly, the points at (-1,0) and (0,1) along with the point (0,-1) and the point (-2,0) form another equilateral triangle but since (-2,0) is not adjacent to the points (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,0), the triangle (-2,0), (0,-1), (-1,0) is not valid.\n\n16. The points at (-1,0) and (0,1) along with the point (0,-1) and the point (-1,-1) form another equilateral triangle but since (-1,-1) is not adjacent to the points (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,0), the triangle (-1,0), (0,1), (-1,-1) is not valid.\n\n17.

The points at (1,0) and (1,1) along with the point (1,-1) and the point (2,0) form another equilateral triangle but since (2,0) is not adjacent to the points (1,-1), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), the triangle (1,0), (1,-1), (2,0) is not valid.\n\nWe have already found the following equilateral triangles:\n\n1. The points at (1,0), (-1,0), and (0,1).\n2. The points at (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1).\n3. The points at (-1,0), (0,1), and (1,1).\n\nNow let's check if there are any other equilateral triangles with a side length of 1 unit in the lattice."
