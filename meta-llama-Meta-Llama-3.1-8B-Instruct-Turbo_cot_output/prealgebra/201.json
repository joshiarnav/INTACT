    "problem": "If only one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water, and only one half of that exposed land area is inhabitable for humans (because of poles, deserts, etc.), what fraction of the earth's surface can humans live on?",
    "solution": "One half of one quarter of the earth is $\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Only one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water. This means 1/4 of the earth's surface is land.\n\n2. Now, this land is further divided into inhabitable and uninhabitable areas. Only one half of the exposed land area is inhabitable for humans. This means the inhabitable land is 1/2 of 1/4, which can be written as (1/2) * (1/4).\n\nTo multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (1*1) and the denominators (2*4). The result is (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8.\n\nSo, one eighth of the earth's surface can be inhabited by humans."
