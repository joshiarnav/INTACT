    "problem": "What is $ 6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8$?",
    "solution": "Recall that multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction. We get \\[\n6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8 = 2 - 2 - 8 + 16.\n\\]We rewrite the subtractions as additions of negations so we can rearrange:  \\begin{align*}\n2 - 2 - 8 + 16 &= 2 + (-2) + (-8) + 16 \\\\\n&= 16 + 2 + (-2) + (-8) \\\\\n&= 18 - (2+8) \\\\\n&= 18-10 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{8}.\n\\end{align*}",

Multiplication and Division (from left to right): \n   - $2 \\cdot 8 = 16$\n4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):\n   - First, we do the division: $6 \\div 3 = 2$\n   - Now, the expression becomes: $2 - 2 - 8 + 16$\n   - Next, we do the subtraction: $2 - 2 = 0$, so the expression becomes: $0 - 8 + 16$\n   - Then, we do the subtraction again: $0 - 8 = -8$, so the expression becomes: $-8 + 16$\n   - Finally, we do the addition: $-8 + 16 = 8$\n\nSo, the final answer is $8$."
