    "problem": "A teacher has a class with $24$ students in it. If she wants to split the students into equal groups of at most $10$ students each, what is the least number of groups that she needs?",
    "solution": "For the teacher to be able to split her students into $x$ groups of $y$ students each, $y$ must be a divisor of $24$. Since we want to create as few groups as possible, we need to maximize the number of students in each group. Thus, $y$ should be the greatest divisor of $24$ that is less than or equal to $10$. This means that $y=8$ and $x=3$. The teacher can create $\\boxed{3}$ groups of $8$ students each.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least number of groups, we need to find the largest possible group size that is less than or equal to 10.\n\nSince we're looking for the largest possible group size, we'll divide the total number of students by 10.\n\nNumber of students / Group size = Number of groups (at most)\n\n24 students / 10 = 2.4\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This is because we can't have a group size of less than 10, but we can have a group of 10.\n\nTherefore, the number of groups will be 3.\n\nHowever, since we know that 24 students divided by 8 is 3, and that 3*8 is 24, the least number of groups that can be made is 3."
