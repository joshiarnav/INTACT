    "model_solution": "To solve for $T$, we need to break down the given problem step by step.\n\n1. Let's first express the given information as an equation.\n   One-half of one-seventh of $T$ can be written as $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{7} \\times T$.\n   One-third of one-fifth of 90 can be written as $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{5} \\times 90$.\n\n2. Therefore, the equation can be written as:\n   $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{7} \\times T = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{5} \\times 90$.\n\n3. Now, let's simplify the equation by multiplying the fractions on both sides.\n   $\\frac{T}{14} = \\frac{90}{15}$\n\n4. To solve for $T$, we need to isolate $T$ on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides by 14.\n   $T = \\frac{90}{15} \\times 14$\n\n5. Now, let's simplify the right side of the equation by first dividing 90 by 15.\n   $T = 6 \\times 14$\n\n6. Now, let's multiply 6 by 14.\n   $T = 84$\n\nTherefore, the value of $T$ is 84."
