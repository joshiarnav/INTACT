    "problem": "A zoo has a menagerie containing four pairs of different animals, one male and one female for each. The zookeeper wishes to feed the animals in a specific pattern: each time he feeds a single animal, the next one he feeds must be a different gender. If he starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many ways can he feed all the animals?",
    "solution": "If the zookeeper starts with the male giraffe, there are 4 females which he can feed next. Once one is selected, there are 3 males he can feed next, then 3 females, 2 males, 2 females, 1 male, and 1 female.\n\nThe total number of possibilities is $4\\times3\\times3\\times2\\times2 = \\boxed{144}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total number of ways the zookeeper can feed the animals, let's break down the process step by step.\n\n1. The zookeeper starts by feeding the male giraffe. This leaves him with 8 animals to feed (2 males and 6 females, excluding the male giraffe). \n\n2. The next animal to feed must be a female. Since there are 6 females to choose from, the zookeeper has 6 options for the second animal.\n\n3. After feeding a female, the next animal to feed must be a male. At this point, there are 3 males left to choose from (excluding the giraffe already fed). \n\n4. The next step is to feed a female, and there are now 5 females left to choose from.\n\n5. After that, the zookeeper must feed a male, with 2 males left to choose from.\n\n6. Then, he must feed a female, with 4 females left to choose from.\n\n7. Finally, the last male is fed. By this point, there is only one male left.\n\nSo, we multiply the options at each step together to get the total number of ways to feed the animals:\n\n6 (second animal) \u00d7 3 (third animal) \u00d7 5 (fourth animal) \u00d7 2 (fifth animal) \u00d7 4 (sixth animal) \u00d7 1 (last male) = 720\n\nHowever, to be strictly accurate, since the zookeeper also has to choose the last female after the last male, he actually also has 4 options for the last female. But since he's not choosing the last of last animal (the female) in a different sequence, we don't need to multiply by 4 again. We already have the last female in sequence after the last male. \n\n720, therefore, is the final correct number of ways."
