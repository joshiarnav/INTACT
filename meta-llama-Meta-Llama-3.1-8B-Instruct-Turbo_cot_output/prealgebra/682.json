    "problem": "If $\\frac{5}{33}$ is expressed in decimal form, what digit is in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point?",
    "solution": "When we write $\\frac{5}{33}$ as a decimal using long division, we get $0.\\overline{15}=0.15151515\\ldots$. Notice the pattern we have here: if $n$ is odd, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal point is $1$; if $n$ is even, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal place is $5$. Since $92$ is an even number, the digit at the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is $\\boxed{5}.$",

    "model_solution": "To express $\\frac{5}{33}$ in decimal form, we can use long division. \n\nFirst, divide 5 by 33:\n\n   ____________________\n33)  0.1515151515...\n\nThe division results in 0.1515151515... (repeating 15). \n\nSince the 15 is repeating, the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point will be the same as every 2nd place. \n\nTo find this digit, we can divide 92 by 2: \n\n92 / 2 = 46.\n\nThis means the 92nd place is the same as the 46th place when counting from the first digit after the decimal point (the 1 in 0.15). \n\nSince the 46th place is also a 5, as 46 / 2 = 23 (meaning the 92nd place is the same as the 23rd place of the repeating section), and 23 / 2 = 11.5 (meaning it is the same as the 11th place in the 15) and the 11th place is 5, the 92nd place is also 5.\n\nSo, the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is 5."
