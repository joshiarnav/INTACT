    "problem": "How many diagonals does a convex polygon with 23 sides have?",
    "solution": "If the polygon has 23 sides, then it has 23 vertices. A diagonal is created by choosing 2 non-adjacent vertices and connecting them. First we choose a vertex. There are 23 choices. Then we choose another vertex that is not adjacent to the one we already chose. There are 20 choices for this. However, we have double counted all the diagonals, so the number of diagonals is $\\frac{23 \\cdot 20}{2}=23 \\cdot 10=\\boxed{230} \\text{ diagonals}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of diagonals in a convex polygon with 23 sides, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. A diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices of the polygon.\n2. Each vertex can be connected to all other vertices, except for its adjacent vertices (the ones it shares an edge with).\n3. Since there are 23 sides, each vertex has 23 - 2 = 21 vertices to potentially connect to with a diagonal. However, we must subtract the vertex itself.\n\n4. However, this is the potential number of diagonals per vertex, but we need the total number of diagonals in the polygon. We need to consider that we counted each diagonal twice, once from each end.\n\n5. Since each diagonal connects two vertices, we can count the total number of diagonals by multiplying the potential number of diagonals per vertex by the number of vertices, and then dividing by 2 to correct for the double counting.\n\n6. So, the formula to find the number of diagonals is: (number of vertices * (number of vertices - 3)) / 2.\n\n7. Plugging in the number of vertices (23) into the formula, we get: (23 * (23 - 3)) / 2 = (23 * 20) / 2 = 460 / 2 = 230.\n\nTherefore, a convex polygon with 23 sides has 230 diagonals."
