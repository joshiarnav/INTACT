    "model_solution": "To find the point P such that AP = BP = CP = DP, we need to find the intersection of the spheres centered at A, B, C, and D with radius AP, BP, CP, and DP respectively.\n\nSince the distance formula in 3D space is given by:\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}\\]\nWe can find the radius of each sphere by calculating the distance between each point and the origin (point D).\n\nFor point A:\n\\[AP = \\sqrt{(8 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{64} = 8\\]\n\nFor point B:\n\\[BP = \\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (-4 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{16} = 4\\]\n\nFor point C:\n\\[CP = \\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{36} = 6\\]\n\nNow that we have the radii of each sphere, we can set up the equations for the intersection of the spheres.\n\nSince the point P lies on each sphere, the distances from P to A, B, C, and D are equal to the radius of each sphere.\n\nLet P = (x, y, z) be the intersection point.\n\nThen, we can set up the following equations:\n\n\\[AP = \\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 0)^2 + (z - 0)^2} = 8\\]\n\\[BP = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y + 4)^2 + (z - 0)^2} = 4\\]\n\\[CP = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 + (z - 6)^2} = 6\\]\n\\[DP = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 + (z - 0)^2} = r\\]\n\nNotice that the radius of the sphere centered at D is r, but we can simplify the equation by noting that the point P lies on the sphere centered at D with radius r. However, since we're looking for the point P where all the spheres intersect, it makes sense to look for a point that is equidistant from the center of each sphere.\n\nA point that is equidistant from the center of each sphere is the center of the sphere that circumscribes the polygon formed by the center of the other three spheres.\n\nSo, the point P is the center of the sphere that circumscribes the triangle with vertices A, B, and C.\n\nThe circumcenter of a triangle is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle intersect.\n\nWe can find the midpoint of each side of the triangle and the slope of each side to find the equation of the perpendicular bisectors.\n\nThe midpoint of side AB is ((8+0)/2, (0-4)/2, (0+0)/2) = (4, -2, 0).\n\nThe midpoint of side BC is ((0+0)/2, (0+0)/2, (6+0)/2) = (0, 0, 3).\n\nThe midpoint of side CA is ((0+8)/2, (0+0)/2, (6+0)/2) = (4, 0, 3).\n\nThe slope of side AB is -4/8 = -1/2.\n\nThe slope of side BC is undefined, since BC is a vertical line.\n\nThe slope of side CA is 0/4 = 0.\n\nWe can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the perpendicular bisectors.\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of side AB has slope 1/2 and passes through point (4, -2, 0). The equation of this line is y + 2 = (1/2)(x - 4).\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of side BC has slope 0 and passes through point (0, 0, 3). The equation of this line is z = 3.\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of side CA has slope 0 and passes through point (4, 0, 3). The equation of this line is z = 3.\n\nWe can solve the system of equations to find the point P.\n\nWe have:\ny + 2 = (1/2)(x - 4) ... (1)\nz = 3\n\nWe can solve for x in terms of y using equation (1):\n\nx = 2(2 - y) + 4 = 8 - 2y\n\nSubstituting x into equation (1), we get:\n\ny + 2 = (1/2)(8 - 2y - 4)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ny + 2 = (1/2)(4 - 2y)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n2y + 4 = 4 - 2y\n\nAdding 2y to both sides, we get:\n\n4y + 4 = 4\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get:\n\n4y = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\ny = 0\n\nSubstituting y = 0 into the equation x = 8 - 2y, we get:\n\nx = 8 - 2(0) = 8\n\nSubstituting x = 8 and y = 0 into the equation z = 3, we get:\n\nz = 3\n\nTherefore, the point P is (8, 0, 3)."
