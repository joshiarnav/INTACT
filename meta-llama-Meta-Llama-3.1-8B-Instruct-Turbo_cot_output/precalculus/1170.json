    "model_solution": "To find the probability, we first need to understand the roots of the equation $z^{1997}-1=0$. \n\nThe solutions to this equation are the $1997$th roots of unity, which are located at the vertices of a regular $1997$-gon in the complex plane, centered at the origin. These roots can be expressed as $\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right)$ for $k = 0,1,\\ldots,1996$.\n\nWe can assume that $v = 1$, as the equation is unchanged if we add or subtract the same value to all of the roots. This follows from the properties of the roots of unity.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le\\left|v+w\\right|$. Since $v = 1$, we can rewrite this inequality as $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le\\left|1+w\\right|$.\n\nLet $\\theta$ be the argument of $w$, so $w = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$. Then, we have\n\n$$\\left|1+w\\right| = \\sqrt{ (1 + \\cos\\theta)^2 + \\sin^2\\theta } = \\sqrt{ 2 + 2\\cos\\theta }.$$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le\\sqrt{ 2 + 2\\cos\\theta }$. This is equivalent to finding the probability that $\\cos\\theta \\ge \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}2$.\n\nThe values of $\\theta$ that satisfy this inequality correspond to the angles in the first and fourth quadrants of the unit circle that are between $\\frac{\\pi}6$ and $\\frac{5\\pi}6$ and their supplementary angles.\n\nThe angles $\\theta$ that satisfy $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}2$ are $\\frac{\\pi}6$ and $\\frac{5\\pi}6$, and their supplementary angles $\\frac{11\\pi}6$ and $\\frac{7\\pi}6$. \n\nTherefore, the total number of values of $\\theta$ that satisfy the inequality is $332$ (note that the total number of distinct roots of the equation is $1996$, which is even, so we can pair each root with its supplementary angle).\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen value of $\\theta$ satisfies the inequality is then $\\frac{332}{1996}$.\n\nHowever, since the distinct roots are chosen randomly, we must also consider that this is the probability for $v = 1$, and $v$ is one of $1996$ roots. So we must find which fraction of the total root combinations this probability falls under.\n\nIf we find the total number of possible distinct root combinations, we can divide our probability value by the total and get the right answer.\n\nNow let's find the total number of possible distinct root combinations. We have $1997$ roots which can be picked from for the root $v$, and for the $w$ root we have $1996$ roots to pick from, since the roots are distinct. \n\nThe total number of distinct root combinations is $1997\\cdot 1996$. \n\nNow we can find the final probability as follows:\n\nThe probability that the randomly chosen value of $\\theta$ satisfies the inequality is $\\frac{332}{1996}$. \n\nWe must divide this probability by the total number of combinations of distinct roots, which is $1997\\cdot 1996$.\n\nTherefore, the final probability is $\\frac{332}{1997\\cdot 1996}$."
