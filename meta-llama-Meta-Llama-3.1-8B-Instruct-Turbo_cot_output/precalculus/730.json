    "model_solution": "We are given two pieces of information: \n\n1. $wz = 12-8i$\n2. $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$\n\nWe want to find the absolute value (or modulus) of $z$, denoted as $|z|$.\n\nSince $wz = 12-8i$, we can take the absolute value of both sides of the equation:\n\n$|wz| = |12-8i|$\n\nUsing the properties of absolute value, we have:\n\n$|w||z| = |12-8i|$\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of $|w|$ that we are given:\n\n$\\sqrt{13} |z| = |12-8i|$\n\nTo find $|12-8i|$, we use the formula for the absolute value of a complex number:\n\n$|a+bi| = \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$\n\nIn this case, $a=12$ and $b=-8$, so:\n\n$|12-8i| = \\sqrt{12^2 + (-8)^2}$\n$= \\sqrt{144 + 64}$\n$= \\sqrt{208}$\n$= \\sqrt{16\\cdot 13}$\n$= 4\\sqrt{13}$\n\nNow that we have $|12-8i|$, we can substitute it back into the equation:\n\n$\\sqrt{13} |z| = 4\\sqrt{13}$\n\nTo solve for $|z|$, we divide both sides by $\\sqrt{13}$:\n\n$|z| = \\frac{4\\sqrt{13}}{\\sqrt{13}}$\n$= 4$\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of $z$ is $4$."
