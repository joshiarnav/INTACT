    "solution": "Two angles have the same tangent if and only if they differ by a multiple of $\\pi.$  This means $\\tan x - x$ is a multiple of $\\pi.$  Let\n\\[T(x) = \\tan x - x.\\]First, we prove that the function $T(x)$ is strictly increasing on the interval $\\left[ 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right).$  Let $0 \\le x < y < \\frac{\\pi}{2}.$  Then\n\\[y - x < \\tan (y - x) = \\frac{\\tan y - \\tan x}{1 + \\tan x \\tan y} \\le \\tan y - \\tan x.\\]Re-arranging, we get $\\tan x - x < \\tan y - y,$ or $T(x) < T(y).$\n\nNote that as $x$ approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2},$ $T(x)$ approaches infinity.  This means for every nonnegative integer $n,$ there exists a unique value of $x$ such that $T(x) = n \\pi.$\n\nWe have the estimate $300 \\pi \\approx 942.48.$  Hence,\n\\[T(\\tan^{-1} 942) = 942 - \\tan^{-1} 942 < 942 < 300 \\pi.\\]Also,\n\\[T(\\tan^{-1} 924) = 942 - \\tan^{-1} 942 > 942 - \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 299 \\pi.\\]Since $299 \\pi < T(\\tan^{-1} 942) < 300 \\pi,$ the equation $T(x) = n \\pi$ has a solution on the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$ if and only if $0 \\le n < 300,$ so there are $\\boxed{300}$ solutions.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$, we need to think about when the two sides of the equation are equal. \n\nLet's consider a function $f(x) = \\tan x$ and $g(x) = \\tan (\\tan x)$. \n\nSince $\\tan x > x$ for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $f(x) > x$ for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nThe two functions start at the origin and increase, then the function $f(x)$ crosses $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and then decreases. \n\nOn the other hand, the function $g(x)$ is a composition of the tangent function with itself, so it has a more complex behavior. \n\nWe know that $g(0) = g(g(0)) = 0$ is a solution. \n\nThen, for $x$ between $0$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the function $g(x)$ will increase, but it will eventually decrease as it approaches $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and then continues to decrease.\n\nNow, we need to find how many times the two functions intersect. \n\nSince both functions are continuous and increasing, the number of intersections on each interval is at most $2$. \n\nSo, the number of intersections is equal to the number of times the function $g(x)$ intersects the line $y = x$ on the interval $(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, plus the number of times the function $g(x)$ intersects the line $y = x$ on the interval $(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\tan^{-1} 942)$.\n\nTo find this, we need to find the values of $x$ for which $\\tan x = x$ on each interval.\n\nFor $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the graphs of $y = \\tan x$ and $y = x$ intersect once, at $(0, 0)$.\n\nFor $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < x < \\tan^{-1} 942$, we will find the number of solutions for the equation $\\tan x = x$.\n\nTo do this, we will use the fact that $\\tan x = x$ is equivalent to $\\tan (x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -x$. \n\nSince $\\tan x = x$ has a solution at $x = 0$, we know that $\\tan (x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -x$ has a solution at $x = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nSince $x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is an odd function and $-x$ is an odd function, we know that $\\tan (x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -x$ has a solution at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nWe also know that $\\tan x = x$ has a solution at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nSince $\\tan x = x$ has a solution at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we know that $\\tan (x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -x$ has a solution at $x = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the equation $\\tan x = x$ has infinitely many solutions in the interval $(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\tan^{-1} 942)$, since the two graphs are asymptotically equal as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe graphs of $y = \\tan x$ and $y = x$ are asymptotically equal as $x \\to \\infty$, because both functions approach the same value, but the function $y = \\tan x$ has vertical asymptotes at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k \\pi$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the graph of $y = \\tan x$ and the graph of $y = x$ have infinitely many intersections in the interval $(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\tan^{-1} 942)$.\n\nTo find the number of solutions for the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$, we need to subtract the number of solutions for the equation $x = \\tan x$ on the interval $(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ from the number of solutions for the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ on the interval $(0, \\tan^{-1} 942)$.\n\nWe know that the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ has a solution at $x = 0$.\n\nThe equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ has infinitely many solutions in the interval $(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\tan^{-1} 942)$.\n\nTherefore, the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ has infinitely many solutions on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$, minus $1$.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is $1 + \\infty - 1 = \\infty$"
