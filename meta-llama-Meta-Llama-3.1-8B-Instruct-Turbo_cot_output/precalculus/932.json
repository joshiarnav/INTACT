    "model_solution": "To find the range of the function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$, we need to consider the restrictions on the input of the function and the behavior of the function itself.\n\n1. **Restrictions on the input:**\n   - The cosine function is defined for all real numbers $x$.\n   - The square root function requires its input to be non-negative.\n   - The logarithm function requires its input to be positive.\n\n2. **Behavior of the cosine function in the given domain:**\n   - The domain of the function is given as $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$. We know that the cosine function is positive in the first and fourth quadrants and negative in the second and third quadrants. In the given domain, the cosine function will be positive, because the cosine of an angle between $-90^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$ is always positive.\n\n3. **Behavior of the square root function:**\n   - Since the cosine function is positive in the given domain, the output of the cosine function will be between $0$ and $1$ (inclusive), because the cosine of an angle between $-90^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.\n   - The square root function will take the output of the cosine function as input. The square root of a number between $0$ and $1$ (inclusive) will be between $0$ and $1$ (inclusive).\n\n4. **Behavior of the logarithm function:**\n   - The logarithm function with base $2$ requires its input to be positive.\n   - The input to the logarithm function is the output of the square root function, which is between $0$ and $1$ (inclusive).\n   - Therefore, the logarithm function will take values in $(-\\infty, 0]$, because the logarithm of a number between $0$ and $1$ (inclusive) with base $2$ will be a negative number.\n\nHowever, we should note that the logarithm function in the definition will be taking the square root of the cosine of x.  And given the domain of $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$, it should be determined that $\\cos x$ will be positive, as mentioned previously.\n\nSince the cosine of x is positive and the logarithm function is base 2, we will only be dealing with values of $\\cos x$ between $0$ and $1$.  Therefore the square root of $\\cos x$ will be between $0$ and $1$.\n\nHowever, if $\\cos x$ is $1$, then the square root of $\\cos x$ will also be $1$, and the base 2 logarithm of $1$ is $0$.  \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the range of the function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ for $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$ is $(-\\infty, 0]$."
