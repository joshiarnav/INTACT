    "solution": "First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\\lceil x \\rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\\lceil x \\rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\\lceil x \\rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\\dfrac{2}{7}=\\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\\dfrac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let $n=\\lceil x \\rceil$ and $0\\le x-n<1$.\nSince $n\\le x<n+1$, we have $n\\le x<n+1$.\nHence $n\\le x\\le n+1$, which gives us $n\\le x < n+1$.\nTherefore $n-1 < x < n$.\nThis gives us $n-1 < x < n$, which implies $0\\le x-n < 1$.\nStep 2: Since $n$ is an integer, this implies that $x$ is a number that lies between $n-1$ and $n$, but is not equal to $n-1$. Substituting into $\\lceil x \\rceil + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}$ gives $n+x=\\dfrac{23}{7}$. Then, $n-1 < x < n$ implies $n-1 < \\dfrac{23}{7}-n < n-1$. This simplifies to $2n-2 < \\dfrac{23}{7} < 2n-1$, which then simplifies to $2n-2 < \\dfrac{23}{7} < 2n-1$. This implies $\\dfrac{15}{7} < n < \\dfrac{16}{7}$. Then $3 < n < 4$. Since $n$ is an integer, this implies $n=4$.\nStep 3: Now we know that $n=4$. We can substitute this into the original equation $n+x=\\dfrac{23}{7}$. This gives $4+x=\\dfrac{23}{7}$. Subtracting $4$ from both sides gives $x=\\dfrac{9}{7}$.\nStep 4: We can substitute $n = 4$ into the inequality $n - 1 < x < n$ to obtain $3 < x < 4$. \nFinal Answer.",
