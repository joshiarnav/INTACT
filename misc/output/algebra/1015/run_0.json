    "problem": "Berengere and her American foreign-exchange student Emily are at a bakery in Paris that accepts both euros and American dollars. They want to buy a cake, but neither of them has enough money. If the cake costs 6 euros and Emily has an American five-dollar bill, how many euros does Berengere need to contribute to the cost of the cake if 1 euro = 1.25 USD?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The easiest way to solve this problem is to convert everything into euros. Emily's five-dollar bill is equivalent to $5\\text{ USD} \\times \\frac{1\\text{ euro}}{1.25\\text{ USD}}=4\\text{ euros}$. Since the girls need 6 euros between them, Berengere must contribute $6-4=\\boxed{2 \\text{ euros}}$.",
