    "solution": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(-8 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\boxed{10}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that the origin, the point $(-8, 6)$, and the point $(-8, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 6 and 8. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the length of the hypotenuse must be $\\boxed{10}$.",
