    "problem": "Solve for $w$ and express as a common fraction: $\\frac{1\\frac16}w=\\frac{42}3$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Simplifying the left side gives \\[\\frac{1\\frac16}{w} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{6}}{w} = \\frac{7}{6}\\cdot\\frac1w = \\frac{7}{6w},\\] so the equation is \\[\\frac{7}{6w} = \\frac{42}{3} = 14.\\] Multiplying both sides by $6w$ gives $7=14(6w)$.  Dividing both sides by 7 gives $1=2(6w)$, and dividing both sides by 12 gives $w = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$.",
