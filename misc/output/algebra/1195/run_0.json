    "problem": "Two consecutive positive even numbers are each squared.  The  difference of the squares is 60.  What is the sum of the original  two numbers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $x + 2$, where $x$ is even. We want to find $x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2$, and we are told that $(x + 2)^2 - x^2 = 60$. This last equation can be factored as a difference of squares: $(x + 2 + x)(x + 2 - x) = (2x + 2)(2) = 60$. It follows that $2x + 2 = 60/2 = \\boxed{30}$.",
