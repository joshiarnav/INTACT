    "problem": "Twelve people purchased supplies for a ten-day camping trip with the understanding that each of the twelve will get equal daily shares. They are then joined by three more people, but make no further purchases. How many days will the supplies last if the original daily share for each person is not changed?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since each person of the original group had 10 daily shares, the total supplies are equivalent to 120 daily shares. When 3 people join the group, the total number of people becomes 15. Then each person in the new group will have $\\frac{120}{15}$ or 8 daily shares. The supplies will last $\\boxed{8}$ days.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the original daily share for each person.\nThe original daily share for the twelve people was the total amount of supplies divided by 12.\n## Step 2: Calculate the new total number of people after the three additional people join.\nThe new total number of people is 12 (original people) + 3 (new people) = 15.\n## Step 3: Determine the new daily share for each person.\nThe new daily share for each of the 15 people remains the same as the original share because no additional supplies were purchased.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
