    "problem": "A ball is dropped straight down from a height of 16 feet. If it bounces back each time to a height one-half the height from which it last fell, how far will the ball have traveled when it hits the floor for the sixth time, in feet?",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The ball first drops 16 feet. It then travels up 8 feet and down 8 feet. When it hits the floor for the sixth time, it will have traveled $16 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 = \\boxed{47}$ feet.",
