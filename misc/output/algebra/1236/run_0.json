    "problem": "If $5$ lunks can be traded for $3$ kunks, and $2$ kunks will buy $4$ apples, how many lunks are needed to purchase one dozen apples?",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "One dozen apples is 12 apples, which costs $2\\cdot3=6$ kunks (since 4 apples cost 2 kunks), which costs $5\\cdot2=\\boxed{10}$ lunks (since 3 kunks cost 5 lunks).",
