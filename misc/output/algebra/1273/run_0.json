    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We complete the square.\n\nWe have $(x-10)^2 = x^2 - 20x + 100$, and so\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2-20x+ 36 &= (x-10)^2 + (36-100) \\\\\n&= (x-10)^2 - 64.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $b=-10$ and $c=-64$, which gives us $b+c = \\boxed{-74}$.",
