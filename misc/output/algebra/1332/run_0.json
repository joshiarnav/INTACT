    "problem": "Daniel works at an electronics store, and he claims that the popularity of a television (measured in number of sales) is inversely proportional to its cost. If 15 customers buy a television that costs $\\$$1500, according to Daniel's theory, how many customers would buy a television that costs $\\$$2500?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the popularity of a television (or the number of customers who buy one) equal $p$, and let the cost of the television equal $c$. According to Daniel's theory, $p$ and $c$ are inversely proportional. Thus, $(p)(c)=k$ for some constant value $k$. If $p=15$ when $c=1500$, then $k=(15)(1500)=22500$. So when $c=2500$, \\begin{align*} (p)(c)&=k\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (p)(2500)&=22500\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad p&=\\frac{22500}{2500}\n\\\\ &=\\boxed{9}.\n\\end{align*}According to Daniel's theory, 9 customers would buy the $\\$2500$ television.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Let $c$ be the cost of the television, and let $p$ be the number of customers who buy it. Then $p=\\frac{k}{c}$, where $k$ is a constant.\nStep 5: Since $p=\\frac{k}{c}$ when $c=\\$$1500, we have $15=\\frac{k}{1500}$, so $k=15 \\cdot 1500=22,500.$\nStep 6:  Now we have $15=\\frac{k}{1500}$ and $k=22,500$, so if $c=\\$$2500$, we have $\\frac{22,500}{2500}=p$, so $p=9$.\nStep 7: The number of customers who would buy a television that costs $\\$$2500 is 9.
