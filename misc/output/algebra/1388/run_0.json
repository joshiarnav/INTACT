    "problem": "By starting with a million and alternatively dividing by 2 and multiplying by 5, Anisha created a sequence of integers that starts 1000000, 500000, 2500000, 1250000, and so on. What is the last integer in her sequence? Express your answer in the form $a^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $a$ is as small as possible.",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Anisha begins with the integer $10^6=(2^6)(5^6)$.  After 12 steps, every factor of 2 is removed and replaced with a factor of $5$, so what remains is $5^6\\cdot 5^6=\\boxed{5^{12}}$.",

We need to determine how many times Anisha can divide by 2 and multiply by 5 before the exponent of 2 becomes 0.\nStep 5: We can track the changes in the exponent of 2 and the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of the numbers in the sequence. Starting with $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$, each division by 2 reduces the exponent of 2 by 1, and each multiplication by 5 increases the exponent of 5 by 1.\nStep 6: After 6 divisions by 2, the exponent of 2 will be 0, and after those 6 divisions, the exponent of 5 will be 12.\nStep 7: After 6 divisions by 2, the exponent of 2 will be 0, and after those 6 divisions, the exponent of 5 will be 12.
