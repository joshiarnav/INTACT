    "solution": "We can start by cross-multiplying: \\begin{align*} 3\\sqrt{x-1}&=2\\sqrt{x}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad (3\\sqrt{x-1})^2 &=(2\\sqrt{x})^2\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 9(x-1)& =4(x)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 9x-9& =4x\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad5x&=9\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=\\boxed{\\frac9{5}}.\n\\end{align*}Checking, we see that this value of $x$ does indeed work, so it is not an extraneous solution.",
