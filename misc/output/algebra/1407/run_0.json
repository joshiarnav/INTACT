    "solution": "Add $(-2/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the first equation and $(-8/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the second equation to find that the given equations are equivalent to \\begin{align*}\n(x^2-2x+1)+(y^2-10y+25)&=1\\text{, and} \\\\\n(x^2-8x+16)+(y^2-10y+25)&=4\n\\end{align*} which are equivalent to \\begin{align*}\n(x-1)^2+(y-5)^2 &=1^2, \\\\\n(x-4)^2+(y-5)^2 &=2^2,\n\\end{align*} respectively.  Hence, the two circles have centers $(1,5)$ and $(4,5)$ respectively and radii $1$ and $2$ respectively. Since the centers of the circles are $3$ units apart and the sum of their radii is $3$, the two circles intersect at only one point.  We can see that $(2,5)$ is the desired intersection point, so our product is $2 \\cdot 5 =\\boxed{10}$.",
