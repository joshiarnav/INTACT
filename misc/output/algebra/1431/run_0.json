    "problem": "It takes Mary 30 minutes to walk uphill 1 km from her home to school, but it takes her only 10 minutes to walk from school to home along the same route. What is her average speed, in km/hr, for the round trip?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Mary walks a total of 2 km in 40 minutes. Because 40 minutes is 2/3  hr, her average speed, in km/hr, is  $\\dfrac{2\\text{ km}}{2/3\\text{ hr}} = \\boxed{3}\\text{ km/hr}.$",
