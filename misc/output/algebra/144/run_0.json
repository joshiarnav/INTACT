    "problem": "How many distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units have integer side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a$, $b$, $c$ is an arithmetic sequence?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $d$ be the common difference, so $a = b - d$ and $c = b + d$.  We can assume that $d$ is positive.  (In particular, $d$ can't be 0, because the triangle is not equilateral.)  Then the perimeter of the triangle is $a + b + c = (b - d) + b + (b + d) = 3b = 60$, so $b = 20$.  Hence, the sides of the triangle are $20 - d$, 20, and $20 + d$.\n\nThese sides must satisfy the triangle inequality, which gives us \\[(20 - d) + 20 > 20 + d.\\] Solving for $d$, we find $2d < 20$, or $d < 10$.  Therefore, the possible values of $d$ are 1, 2, $\\dots$, 9, which gives us $\\boxed{9}$ possible triangles.",

Substituting $a$, $b$, and $c$ with their equivalent expressions in terms of $x$ and $d$, we get the equation $3x = 40$, which yields $x = \\frac{40}{3}$.\n  $d = 40 - 2x$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
