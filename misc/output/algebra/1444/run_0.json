    "problem": "What is the slope of a line perpendicular to the line containing the points $(4,-7)$ and $(-5,-1)$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The slope of the line containing $(4, -7)$ and $(-5, -1)$ is $\\frac{-7 - (-1)}{4 - (-5)}=\\frac{-6}{9} = -\\frac{2}{3}$.  Since the other line is perpendicular to this one its slope is the negative reciprocal of $-\\frac{2}{3}$, giving us $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",
