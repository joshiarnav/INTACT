    "problem": "Two-thirds of the people in a room are seated in three-fourths of the chairs. The rest of the people are standing. If there are 6 empty chairs, how many people are in the room?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Because the 6 empty chairs are $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the chairs in the room, there are $6\\times 4=24$ chairs in all. The number of seated people is $\\frac{3}{4}\\times24=18$, and this is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the people present. It follows that \\[\\frac{18}{\\textrm{people present}}=\\frac{2}{3}.\\]So there are $\\boxed{27}$ people in the room.",
    "is_solved": false,
    "model_solution": "Let x be the total number of chairs in the room. Since there are 6 empty chairs, three-fourths of the chairs, which is 3x/4, minus 6, equals the number of seated people.\nWe know that the number of seated people is two-thirds of the total number of people in the room. Let y be the total number of people. So, we have the equation (3x/4) - 6 = (2/3)y.\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 12 to eliminate the fractions: 12(3x/4 - 6) = 12(2/3)y becomes 9x - 72 = 8y.\n9x - 72 = 8y\n9x = 8y + 72\nx = (8/9)y + 8\nSince we need to find the total number of people (y), we can plug x into the equation 3x/4 - 6 = (2/3)y from earlier using the expression we found for x. So, we get 3((8/9)y + 8)/4 - 6 = (2/3)y.\nSimplify the equation: 3((8/9)y + 8)/4 - 6 = (2/3)y becomes ((24/36)y + 24)/4 - 6 = (2/3)y\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 36 to eliminate the fractions: (24/36)y + 24)/4 - 6 = (2/3)y becomes (24/36)y + 24 - 216 = 24y\n((24/36)y + 24 - 216) = 24y \n9y + 24 - 216 = 72y\n67y = 192\nDivide both sides of the equation by 67: y = 192/67",
