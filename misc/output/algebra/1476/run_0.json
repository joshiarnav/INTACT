    "problem": "The denominator of a fraction is 7 less than 3 times the numerator.  If the fraction is equivalent to $2/5$, what is the numerator of the fraction?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We let the numerator be $x$, so the denominator is $3x-7$.  Because the fraction equals $2/5$, we have $x/(3x-7) = 2/5$.  Multiplying both sides by $5(3x-7)$ (or cross-multiplying) gives $5x = 2(3x-7)$.  Expanding the right side gives $5x = 6x - 14$.  Subtracting $6x$ from both sides gives $-x = -14$, so we find $x = \\boxed{14}$.",
