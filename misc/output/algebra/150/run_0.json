    "problem": "Luke wants to fence a square piece of land of at least 400 square feet. What should the side of the square be if he wants to use the least amount of fencing?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The area of the land would be $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of the side. Since it has to be at least 400 square feet, we get $s^2\\geq 400$. Therefore, we get that $s \\le -20 \\text{ or } s \\ge 20$. Since the dimensions can't be negative, the least value of $s$ would be $\\boxed{20}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let x be the side length of the square.\nStep 2: The area of the square is x^2, and we want this to be at least 400, so we have the inequality x^2 \u2265 400.\nStep 3: Taking the square root of both sides of the inequality, we get x \u2265 20.\nStep 4: Since x \u2265 20 and the amount of fencing is proportional to the perimeter of the square, which is 4x, the least amount of fencing will be used when x = 20.\nStep 5: The amount of fencing needed is given by the perimeter of the square, which is 4x. Since we want to use the least amount of fencing, x = 20.\nStep 6: The amount of fencing needed is 4(20) = 80 feet.\nStep 5: The amount of fencing needed is given by the perimeter of the square, which is 4x.
