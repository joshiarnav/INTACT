    "problem": "The first term of an arithmetic sequence is 1, another term of the sequence is 91 and all of the terms of the sequence are integers. How many distinct arithmetic sequences meet these three conditions?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "An arithmetic sequence is formed by adding the common difference to each term to find the next term.  Thus, the common difference must evenly divide the difference $91-1=90$.  Each factor of 90 will correspond to one possible sequence.  For example, the factor 30 corresponds to the sequence $1,31,61,91,...$.  So, we need to count the factors of 90.  Factoring, we find: $$90=2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5$$ So, 90 has: $$(1+1)(2+1)(1+1)=12\\text{ factors}$$ This corresponds to $\\boxed{12}$ possible sequences.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem requires finding the number of distinct arithmetic sequences that satisfy certain conditions. We are given that the first term of the sequence is 1, another term of the sequence is 91, and all terms of the sequence are integers.\n## Step 2:  The common difference (d) between consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence can be calculated by subtracting a term from its previous term. In this case, we have two consecutive terms: 1 and 91. So, the common difference (d) is 91 - 1 = 90.\n## Step 3:  However, an arithmetic sequence must have a common difference (d) that divides the difference between the terms. In this case, the difference between 91 and 1 is 90. Therefore, d must divide 90.\n## Step 2:  Factorize 90 to determine all possible values of d, considering only positive divisors since a negative common difference would yield the same sequence. The positive divisors of 90 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
