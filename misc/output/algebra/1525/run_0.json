    "problem": "Zachary paid for a $\\$1$ burger with 32 coins and received no change. Each coin was either a penny or a nickel. What was the number of nickels Zachary used?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If $p$ is the number of pennies and $n$ is the number of nickels that Zachary used, then we are given \\begin{align*}\np+n&=32\\text{, and} \\\\\np+5n&=100.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second, we find $4n=68$ which implies $n=\\boxed{17}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Let $p$ be the number of pennies and $n$ be the number of nickels. Since there are 32 coins, $p+n=32$.\nSince each nickel is worth $\\$0.05$and each penny is worth$\\$0.01$, the equation $0.05n+0.01p=1$ holds.\nMultiply both sides of $0.05n+0.01p=1$ by $100$ to get $5n+p=100$.\nSubstitute $32-n$ for $p$ in $5n+p=100$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6. I hope it is correct.",
