    "solution": "Let the two numbers be $m=AB$ and $n=CD$ (where $A,B,C$ and $D$ are digits). The average of $m$ and $n$ is $\\frac{m+n}{2}$ and the number formed by writing $m$ before the decimal point and $n$ after the decimal point is: $$AB.CD = AB + 0.CD = AB+\\frac{CD}{100} = m+\\frac{n}{100}.$$ Setting these equal gives: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{m+n}{2} &= m+\\frac{n}{100}\\\\\n50m+50n &= 100m+n\\\\\n49n &= 50m\n\\end{align*} From this it follows that $n$ a multiple of 50. As $n$ is a 2-digit positive integer this means that $n=50$. So now $50m = 49n = 49\\cdot 50$, so $m=49$. Thus the integers are $49$ and $50$, so the smaller integer is $\\boxed{49}$.",

We can set these two quantities equal to each other to form an equation and solve for $m$ and $n$.\nStep 3:  We have the equation $\\frac{m+n}{2} = m + \\frac{n}{100}$. Multiplying through by $100$ to clear the denominator, we get $100\\cdot \\frac{m+n}{2} = 100m + n$, which simplifies to $50m + 50n = 100m + n$.\nStep 4: $49n = 50m$\nStep 5: $49n = 50m \\Rightarrow 7n = 10m \\Rightarrow 7n = 10(m+7) \\Rightarrow 7n = 10(2n) \\Rightarrow 7n = 20n \\Rightarrow 13n = 0 \\Rightarrow n = 0$, which is impossible since $n$ is a 2-digit positive integer. So, $m$ and $n$ are multiples of 7 and 10, respectively.\nSince $m$ and $n$ are 2-digit integers with $10 \\leq m < n < 100$, and both $m$ and $n$ must be multiples of 7 and 10, respectively, \nthe possible values for $n$ are $n = 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84$, \nand the corresponding possible values for $m$ are $7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91$.\nSince $49n = 50m$, $n$ must be a multiple of 10 because the numbers are 2-digit integers.\nSince $n$ is a multiple of 10, we can disregard the values of $n$ that are not multiples of 10. Thus, the possible values for $n$ are $n = 14, 70$.\nStep 6:  Consider the possible values for $n$ to be $n = 14, 70$. For each value of $n$, calculate the corresponding value of $m$ using $49n = 50m$. For $n = 14$, we have $49(14) = 50m \\Rightarrow 686 = 50m \\Rightarrow 13.72 = m$, which is impossible since $m$ is a 2-digit positive integer. For $n = 70$, we have $49(70) = 50m \\Rightarrow 3430 = 50m \\Rightarrow 68.6 = m$, which is again impossible since $m$ is a 2-digit positive integer. However, for $n = 28$, we have $49(28) = 50m \\Rightarrow 1372 = 50m \\Rightarrow 27.44 = m$, which is also impossible.
