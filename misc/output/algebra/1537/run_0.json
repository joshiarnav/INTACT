    "problem": "Xanthia can read 100 pages per hour and Molly can read 50 pages per hour. If they each read the same book, and the book has 225 pages, how many more minutes than Xanthia would it take for Molly to finish reading the book?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Reading the book takes Xanthia\n\n$\\frac{225}{100}=2.25$ hours.\n\nIt takes Molly\n\n$\\frac{225}{50}=4.5$ hours.\n\nThe difference is $2.25$ hours, or $2.25(60)=\\boxed{135}$ minutes.",

Calculate how long it takes Xanthia to read the book:\nXanthia's reading rate: 100 pages per hour\nBook's page count: 225 pages\nXanthia's reading time: 225 pages / 100 pages per hour = 2.25 hours\n2. Calculate how long it takes Molly to read the book:\nMolly's reading rate: 50 pages per hour\nBook's page count: 225 pages\nMolly's reading time: 225 pages / 50 pages per hour = 4.5 hours\n3. Convert both reading times from hours to minutes: \nXanthia's reading time in minutes: 2.25 hours \u00d7 60 minutes per hour = 135 minutes\nMolly's reading time in minutes: 4.5 hours \u00d7 60 minutes per hour = 270 minutes\n4.
