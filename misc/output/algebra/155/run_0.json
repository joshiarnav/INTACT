    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the interest is simple interest, then she earns $0.1(\\$10,\\!000) = \\$1,\\!000$ each year.  Therefore, at the end of 5 years, she has earned $5(\\$1,\\!000) = \\$5,\\!000$.  So, her investment is now worth $\\$10,\\!000 + \\$5,\\!000 = \\boxed{\\$15,\\!000}$.",
