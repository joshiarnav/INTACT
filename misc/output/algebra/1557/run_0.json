    "problem": "The weight of $A$ is $40\\%$ greater than the weight of $B$ but $30\\%$ less than the weight of $C$. What is the ratio of the weight of $B$ to the weight of $C$ expressed as a common fraction?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $A=\\frac{140}{100}B=\\frac{70}{100}C$, or $A=1.4B=.7C$. Now we can solve for the ratio of $B$ to $C$. $$\\frac{B}{C}=\\frac{.7}{1.4}=\\frac{1}{2}$$ The ratio is $\\boxed{\\frac12}$.",

The weight of $A$ is also $30\\%$ less than the weight of $C$, which can be expressed as $0.7y$. Since both expressions represent the weight of $A$, they are equal to each other.
