    "problem": "Charlize accidentally omitted two consecutive integers when adding the elements of the arithmetic sequence, $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n\\}$. If the sum she obtained is $241$, what is the smallest possible value of $n$?",

    "solution": "The sum of the arithmetic series $1+2+3+ \\cdots + n$ is equal to $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Let $k$ and $k+1$ be the two consecutive integers removed, so that their sum is $2k+1$. It follows that \\[\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - (2k+1) = 241.\\]\n\nThe smallest numbers that Charlize could have omitted are 1 and 2, so \\[241 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - (2k+1) \\le \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 3,\\] which gives us the inequality $n(n + 1) \\ge 488$.  If $n = 21$, then $n(n + 1) = 462$, and if $n = 22$, then $n(n + 1) = 506$, so $n$ must be at least 22.\n\nThe largest numbers that Charlize could have omitted are $n$ and $n - 1$, so \\[241 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - (2k+1) \\ge \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - n - (n - 1) = \\frac{(n - 1)(n - 2)}{2},\\] which gives us the inequality $(n - 1)(n - 2) \\le 482$.  If $n = 23$, then $(n - 1)(n - 2) = 462$, and if $n = 24$, then $(n - 1)(n - 2) = 506$, so $n$ must be at most 23.\n\nFrom the bounds above, we see that the only possible values of $n$ are 22 and 23.\n\nIf $n = 22$, then the equation \\[\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - (2k+1) = 241\\] becomes $253 - (2k + 1) = 241$, so $2k + 1 = 12$.  This is impossible, because $2k + 1$ must be an odd integer.\n\nTherefore, $n = \\boxed{23}$.  Note that $n = 23$ is possible, because Charlize can omit the numbers 17 and 18 to get the sum $23 \\cdot 24/2 - 17 - 18 = 241$.",
