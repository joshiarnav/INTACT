    "problem": "If $x \\geq 0$ and $y \\geq 0$, how many lattice points does the line $y = -2x + 18$ pass through? (A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We look at the $x$-intercept and the $y$-intercept. Since $y = -2(x - 9)$, at $x = 0,\\; y = 18$, and at $x = 9,\\; y = 0$, the $y$-intercept is $(0,18)$ and the $x$-intercept is $(9,0)$. In order to keep both $x$ and $y$ integral, we investigate further. Since the slope is $-2$, a negative integer, and $y$ must be a nonnegative integer, $x - 9$ must be a nonpositive integer. This means that all the integer $x$ values between 0 and $9$, inclusive are valid, since $x \\leq 9$ and so $x - 9 \\leq 0$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{10}$ total lattice points.",

We can start by plugging in x = 0 and then continue with increasing values of x as long as the corresponding y-value is a non-negative integer.\nStep 3: Plug in x = 0 into the equation y = -2x + 18 to find the corresponding value of y, which is y = 18. This is a valid lattice point. Then plug in x = 1 to find corresponding y-value, which is y = 16.
