    "problem": "While walking by a classroom, Linda sees two perfect squares written on a blackboard.  She notices that their difference is her favorite number, 99.  She also notices that there are exactly two other perfect squares between them.  What is the sum of the two perfect squares on the blackboard?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We name those two perfect squares on the blackboard $a^2$ and $b^2$. We are given that $a^2-b^2=99$. Factoring, we get $(a-b)(a+b)=99$.\nSince the two perfect squares have two other perfect squares between them, we know that $a-b=3$. Therefore, $a+b=33$. Adding the two equations together, we get $2a=36$. Therefore, $a=18$ and $b=15$. Thus, the sum of the two perfect squares is $a^2+b^2=324+225=\\boxed{549}$.",
