    "solution": "Multiply both sides of the given equation by both denominators to obtain \\begin{align*}\n5(10x-3y)&=3(13x-2y) \\implies \\\\\n50x-15y&=39x-6y.\n\\end{align*} Collect like terms by adding $15y$ and $-39x$ to both sides to obtain $11x=9y$. Finally, divide both sides by $11y$ to find that $\\dfrac{x}{y}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{11}}$.",
