    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In an arithmetic sequence, the average of two terms equals the value of the term halfway between them.  So we have that $b = \\frac{17 + 41}{2} = \\boxed{29}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: The sequence is arithmetic, so the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\nThe difference between $17$ and $a$ is equal to the difference between $a$ and $b$, which is equal to the difference between $b$ and $c$, which is equal to the difference between $c$ and $41.$\n## Step 2: Let $d$ be the common difference between consecutive terms in the sequence.\nThen $a = 17 + d$, $b = a + d = 17 + 2d$, $c = b + d = 17 + 3d$, and $41 = c + d = 17 + 4d.$\n## Step 3: Solve for $d$ in the equation $41 = 17 + 4d.$\nThen $d = \\frac{41-17}{4} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6.$\n## Step 4: Substitute $d = 6$ into $b = 17 + 2d.$\n$b = 17 + 2(6) = 17 + 12 = 29.$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$",
