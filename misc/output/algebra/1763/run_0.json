    "problem": "Raymond normally has a snack consisting of ten 12-calorie crackers. How many 20-calorie cookies would he have to eat to consume the same number of calories?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Raymond consumes a total of $10\\cdot12=120$ calories at snack. If he eats $c$ cookies, he would get $20c$ calories, so since he needs this to equal 120, he must eat $c=120/20=\\boxed{6}$ cookies.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Identify the total calories in the snack Raymond normally has. \n10 * 12\nStep 2: Calculate the calories in each cookie and the number of cookies needed to match the calories in the snack. \n(540/20)\nStep 3: \n27\nStep 4: The total number of calories in the snack is the same as the total number of calories in the cookies, so Raymond would still have 27 cookies.
