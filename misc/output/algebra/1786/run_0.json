    "solution": "For a quadratic to have two real roots, the discriminant must be greater than 0. So we require \\begin{align*}7^2-4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot c &> 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 49-12c &>0\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ c&<\\frac{49}{12}.\\end{align*}The largest integer smaller than $\\frac{49}{12}$ is 4.
