    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Note that $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} >0$ for all nonzero $x$. That is, the range of $f$ must only include positive numbers. Conversely, if $a$ is a positive number, then \\[f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{(1/\\sqrt{a})^2} = a,\\]so $a$ is indeed in the range of $f$. Thus, the range of $f$ is the set of all positive real numbers; in interval notation, that's $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$.",

The function represents a rational function with a non-zero denominator, which means it will have no restrictions on its domain.\nStep 3: Since $x^2$ is always positive for all non-zero values of $x$, the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$ will always yield positive values, excluding the value 0.\nStep 4: The range of the function is all positive real numbers.\nStep 4: The range of the function is all positive real numbers, which can be expressed mathematically as $(0, \\infty)$.\nStep 5: Since the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$ can take any positive real value, the range is $(0, \\infty)$.\nStep 5: The range of the function is all positive real numbers, which can be expressed mathematically as $(0, \\infty)$.\nStep 6: The range of the function is $(0, \\infty)$.\nStep 6: The range of the function is $(0, \\infty)$.",
