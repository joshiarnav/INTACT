    "problem": "What is the sum of all the three-digit positive integers?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We want to evaluate the arithmetic series $100 + 101 + \\cdots + 999$.   The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The total number of three-digit integers is $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$, so the sum is $(100 + 999)/2 \\cdot 900 = \\boxed{494550}$.",

The smallest three-digit integer is 100 and the largest three-digit integer is 999.\nStep 2: Calculate the number of three-digit positive integers by subtracting the smallest three-digit integer from the largest three-digit integer and adding 1: 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.\nStep 3: Calculate the average of the smallest and largest three-digit integers: (100 + 999) / 2 = 549.5\n Final Answer",
