    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If $2x^2 + 5x + b = 0$ has two rational solutions, then its discriminant, $5^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot b = 25 - 8b$, must be a perfect square. Since $b$ is positive, it follows that $25 - 8b \\ge 0 \\Longrightarrow b \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. Checking each one, we see that $b = 2$ and $b = 3$ indeed work, and their sum is $2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Recall the condition for a quadratic equation to have rational roots, which is that the discriminant (the expression under the square root in the quadratic formula) must be a perfect square.

Then, we have $25 - 8b = k^2.$\nStep 3: Rearrange the equation to solve for $b$: $8b = 25 - k^2$, so $b = \\frac{25-k^2}{8}$.\nStep 4: Find the possible values of $k$ such that $\\frac{25-k^2}{8}$ is a positive integer, which means $25 - k^2$ must be a positive multiple of 8.\nStep 5: Note that we can write $25 - k^2 = 8m$, where $m$ is a positive integer. Then $k^2 = 25 - 8m$, which means $k^2$ must be an odd number because $25$ is odd and $8m$ is even. Since $k^2$ is odd, $k$ must be odd, so $k$ can be written as $k = 2n + 1$, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer.\nStep 6: Substitute $k = 2n + 1$ into $k^2 = 25 - 8m$, which yields $(2n + 1)^2 = 25 - 8m$. Expanding the left side gives $4n^2 + 4n + 1 = 25 - 8m$.
