    "problem": "New York and Denver are in different time zones.  When it is noon in New York, it is 10 a.m. in Denver.  A train leaves New York at 2 p.m. (New York time) and arrives in Denver 45 hours later.  What time is it in Denver when the train arrives?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "2 p.m. New York time is noon in Denver.  45 hours past noon is 21 hours past noon the next day, which is 9 a.m. the day after that.  Think about it this way - 48 hours would mean two full days, and 45 hours is 3 hours less than that, thus, 3 hours before noon is $\\boxed{9\\text{ a.m.}}$",

    "model_solution": "Let x be the number of hours ahead in Denver time when it is noon in New York.\n2p.m. (New York time) is x + 4 hours ahead of noon, so the train's departure time in Denver is x + 4.\nThe train takes x + 4 + 45 = x + 49 hours to travel from New York to Denver in terms of Denver time.\nSince the train takes x + 49 hours to travel from New York to Denver in terms of Denver time, and it takes x hours to go from noon in New York to noon in Denver, the train's arrival time in Denver is x hours after noon in Denver, so the train arrives x hours after x + 4 hours after noon in Denver, which is 3x + 4 hours after noon in Denver.\nSince it is noon in Denver when it is 10 a.m. in New York, x = 2 hours.\nThe train arrives 3x + 4 hours after noon in Denver.\nSubstitute x = 2 into 3x + 4.\n3(2) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10\nSubstitute x = 2 into 3x + 4.",
