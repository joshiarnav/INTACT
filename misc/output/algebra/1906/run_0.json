    "problem": "A chess team has $26$ members. However, only $16$ members attended the last meeting: half of the girls attended but all of the boys attended. How many boys are on the chess team?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let there be $B$ boys and $G$ girls. Since every member is either a boy or a girl, $B+G=26$. Also, we have $\\frac{1}{2}G+B=16$. Multiplying the second equation by $2$, we get $G+2B=32$. Subtracting the first equation from this, we get $B=32-26=6$.\n\nThus there are $\\boxed{6}$ boys on the chess team.",

We are given that b + g = 26\nWe are given that $\\frac{1}{2} g + b = 16$\nMultiply the second equation by $2$ to get $g + 2 b = 32$\nSubtract the first equation from this equation to get $b = 6$\nNext step: b = number of boys on the team.
