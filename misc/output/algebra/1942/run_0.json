    "problem": "If the function $j(x)$ is defined only on domain $[-1,2]$, and is defined on this domain by the formula $$j(x) = 2x^2+1,$$ then what is the range of $j(x)$? Express your answer as an interval or as a union of intervals.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Note that $x^2$ assumes every value from $0$ to $4$, inclusive, as $x$ varies throughout the interval $[-1,2]$. Therefore, $j(x)$ assumes every value from $2(0)+1=1$ to $2(4)+1=9$ (and no other values). The range of $j(x)$ is $\\boxed{[1,9]}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: To find the range of $j(x)$, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of $j(x)$ on the domain $[-1,2]$.\n\n$$j(x)=2x^2+1$$\nStep 2: The function $j(x) = 2x^2+1$ is a quadratic function that opens upwards since the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is positive. Therefore, the minimum value of $j(x)$ occurs at the lowest value of $x$ in the domain $[-1,2]$, which is $x=-1$.\n\n$$j(-1)=2(-1)^2+1=3$$\nStep 3: Because the function is continuous on the domain $[-1,2]$, the range of $j(x)$ will be the closed interval from the minimum value of $j(x)$ to the maximum value of $j(x)$ on the domain. The maximum value of $j(x)$ occurs at $x=2$, which is the highest value of $x$ in the domain $[-1,2]$.\n\n$$j(2)=2(2)^2+1=9$$\nStep 4: Since the function $j(x)$ is a quadratic function that opens upwards, the minimum value of $j(x)$ is $j(-1) = 3$ and the maximum value is $j(2) = 9$. The range of $j(x)$ is the closed interval from the minimum to the maximum value.\n\n\nFinal Answer",
