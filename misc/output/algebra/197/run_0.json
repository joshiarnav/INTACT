    "solution": "Since $f(x)$ is a linear function, we can write $f(x) = ax + b$.  We want to find the inverse function $g(x)$ defined by $f(g(x))=x$ for every $x$.  If we substitute $g(x)$ into the equation for $f$ we get  \\[f(g(x))=ag(x)+b.\\]Using that the left side is $f(g(x))=x$ we get \\[x=ag(x)+b.\\]Solving for $g$ we obtain \\[g(x)=\\dfrac{x-b}{a}.\\]Substituting $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ into the given equation, we get \\[ax + b = 4 \\cdot \\frac{x-b}{a} + 6\\]Multiplying both sides by $a$, we get \\[a^2 x + ab = 4x - 4b + 6a.\\]For this equation to hold for $\\emph{all}$ values of $x$, we must have the coefficient of $x$ on both sides equal, and the two constant terms equal. Setting the coefficients of $x$ equal gives $a^2 = 4$, so $a = \\pm2$. Setting constant terms equal gives $ab = -4b + 6a$. If $a = 2$, we have $2b = -4b + 12$, which gives $b = 2$. If $a = -2$, we have $-2b = -4b - 12$, so $b = -6$. Thus we have two possibilities: $f(x) =2x + 2$ or $f(x) = -2x - 6$.\n\nWe're given that $f(1) = 4$, and testing this shows that the first function is the correct choice. So finally, $f(2) = 2(2) + 2 = \\boxed{6}$.",
