    "problem": "If six cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, and four brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, how many cupcakes can Bob buy for the price of eighteen cookies?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since 6 cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, 18 cookies will cost the same as 6 brownies.  Similarly, 4 brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, so 6 brownies will cost the same as $10\\cdot \\frac{6}{4} = 15$ cupcakes.  Therefore, 18 cookies have the same price as $\\boxed{15}$ cupcakes.",
