    "solution": "Let $S = a_1 + a_3 + \\dots + a_{97}$ and $T = a_2 + a_4 + \\dots + a_{98}$. Then the given equation states that $S + T = 137$, and we want to find $T$.\n\nWe can build another equation relating $S$ and $T$: note that \\[\\begin{aligned} T-S &= (a_2-a_1) + (a_4-a_3) + \\dots + (a_{98}-a_{97}) \\\\ &= \\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\dots + 1}_{49 \\text{ times }} \\\\ &= 49 \\end{aligned}\\]since $(a_n)$ has common difference $1$. Then, adding the two equations $S+T=137$ and $T-S=49$, we get $2T=137+49=186$, so $T = \\tfrac{186}{2} = \\boxed{93}$.",
