    "problem": "Kim has exactly enough money to buy 40 oranges at $3x$ cents each. If the price rose to $4x$ cents per orange, how many oranges could she buy?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the total cost is fixed, then the relationship between cost per item and the number of items is inversely proportional.  Since each orange costs $\\frac{4}{3}$ as much, the same amount of money purchases $\\frac{3}{4}$ as many of them.  Taking three-fourths of 40, we find that Kim could buy $\\boxed{30}$ oranges.",
