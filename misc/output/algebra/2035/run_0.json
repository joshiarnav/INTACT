    "solution": "The slope of line segment $QP$ is $1.$ Since the \"rise\" of $QP$ is $6$ units, the \"run\" of $QP$ should also be $6$ units. Therefore, $Q$ is $6$ units horizontally to the left of $P,$ and so has coordinates $(-5,0).$\n\nThe slope of line segment $RP$ is $2.$ Since the rise of $RP$ is $6$ units, then the run of $RP$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 6=3$ units. Therefore, $R$ is $3$ units horizontally to the left of $P,$ and so has coordinates $(-2,0).$\n\n(We could have used the coordinates of $P$ and the slopes of the lines to find that the equations of the lines are $y=x+5$ and $y=2x+4$ and used them to find the coordinates of $Q$ and $R.$)\n\nTherefore, $QR=-2-(-5)=3$ and $P$ is $6$ units above the $x$-axis. Thus, treating $QR$ as the base of $\\triangle PQR,$ we find that its area is $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3\\cdot 6=\\boxed{9}.$$",
