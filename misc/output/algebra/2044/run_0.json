    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We start out with the equation $n(n + 1) = 2550$. Expanding, we find $n^2 + n - 2550 = 0$. This factors to $(n - 50)(n + 51) = 0$, so $n = 50\\text{ or }-51.$ Since $n$ must be negative, we have $n = -51$, hence our two integers are $n = -51$ and $n + 1= -50$, which add up to $\\boxed{-101}$.",
