    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The arithmetic sequence 1, 3, 5, $\\dots$, 17, has common difference 2, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term is $1 + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 1$.  If $2n - 1 = 17$, then $n = 9$, so this arithmetic sequence contains 9 terms.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(1 + 17)/2 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{81}$.",
