    "solution": "Consider two arbitrary polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ with highest degree terms $x^n$ and $x^m$, respectively. Then $p(q(x)) = (q(x))^n + \\cdots = (x^m + \\cdots)^n + \\cdots = x^{mn} + \\cdots$ is a polynomial of degree $mn$. It follows that $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $18$. Then, either $g(h(x))$ or $h(f(x))$ must be a polynomial of degree $36$. This gives that the degree of $h(x)$ is either $12$ or $6$, but in the former case, the degree of $h(f(x))$ would be $72$. Thus, the degree of $h$ is $\\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: The degree of $f(g(x))$ must equal the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$ because $f$ is a polynomial of degree $6$ and $g$ is a polynomial of degree $3$. Thus, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $6 \\cdot 3 = 18$.\nStep 2: The degree of $g(h(x))$ must equal the product of the degrees of $g$ and $h$, and the degree of $h(f(x))$ must equal the product of the degrees of $h$ and $f$. Therefore, the degree of $g(h(x))$ is $3d$ and the degree of $h(f(x))$ is $6d$, where $d$ is the degree of the polynomial $h$.\nStep 3: Let $d$ be the degree of $h(x)$. Then the degree of the polynomial $f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))$ must equal the maximum degree of $f(g(x))$, $g(h(x))$, and $h(f(x))$, which is $\\max(18,6d,3d)$, and this is equal to 36.\nStep 4: Solve the equation $18 = \\max(18,6d,3d)$ for $d$.\nStep 5: $6d=36$ or $3d=36$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$",
