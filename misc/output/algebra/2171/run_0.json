    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula: \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(-15-0)^2 + (8-0)^2} &= \\sqrt{225 + 64} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{289} = \\boxed{17}.\n\\end{align*} - OR -\n\nNote that the origin, the point $(-15, 8)$, and the point $(-15, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length $8$ and $15.$ This is a Pythagorean triple, so the length of the hypotenuse is $\\boxed{17}$.",
