    "problem": "If Heidi can paint a wall in 45 minutes, what fractional part of the wall can she paint in 9 minutes?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $9$ minutes is $1/5$ of $45$ minutes, we can find the fractional part of a wall that Heidi can paint in $9$ minutes by dividing the amount of wall that Heidi can paint in $45$ minutes by $5$. Since Heidi can paint a whole wall in $45$ minutes, it follows that she can paint $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$ of a wall in $9$ minutes.",
