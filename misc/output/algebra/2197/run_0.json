    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $f$ is a linear function, its slope is constant. Therefore\n\n\\[\\frac{f(6) - f(2)}{6-2} = \\frac{f(12) - f(2)}{12 - 2},\\]so \\[\\frac{12}{4} =\\frac{f(12) - f(2)}{10},\\]and $f(12) - f(2) = \\boxed{30}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let $f(x) = ax + b$ for constants $a$ and $b.$\nStep 2: Using the definition of $f$ and the given information, we have $f(6)-f(2)=(6a+b)-(2a+b)=12.$\nStep 3: Simplifying the expression we obtained in Step 2, we have $4a=12$.\nStep 4: Divide both sides of the equation $4a=12$ by 4 to get $a=3.$\nStep 5: We have $f(x) = 3x + b$ for some constant $b$, and so $f(12) - f(2) = (3 \\cdot 12 + b) - (3 \\cdot 2 + b) = 36 - 6.$\nStep 6: $f(12) - f(2) = 30.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 30.",
