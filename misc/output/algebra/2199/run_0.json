    "problem": "Hillary has eleven coins, all dimes and nickels. In total, the coins are worth 75 cents. How many nickels does she have?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of dimes Hillary has be $d$ and the number of nickels she has be $n$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\nd+n&=11\\\\\n10d+5n&=75\n\\end{align*} (The last equation is in terms of cents.) To make the second equation nicer, we divide both sides by 5 to get $2d+n=15$. From the first given equation, we have $d=11-n$. Substituting this into the simplified second given equation to eliminate $d$, we get $2(11-n)+n=15\\Rightarrow n=7$. Thus, Hillary has $\\boxed{7}$ nickels.",

    "model_solution": "Let d be the number of dimes and n be the number of nickels. The total value of the coins is 11d + 5n = 75.\nSince each nickel is 5 cents and each dime is 10 cents, we can subtract 5 times the number of nickels from the total value to make the equation more manageable. So, subtract 5n from both sides of the equation: 11d = 75 - 5n.\nDivide both sides by 11: d = (75 - 5n)/11.\nSince d must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a coin), we can set up the inequality 0 \u2264 (75 - 5n)/11 < 8, because the maximum number of dimes is 8.\nDivide all three parts of the inequality by 11: 0 \u2264 (75 - 5n)/11 \u2264 8 becomes 0 \u2264 75 - 5n \u2264 88.\nSubtract 75 from all parts of the inequality: -75 \u2264 -5n \u2264 13.\nDivide all three parts of the inequality by -5 and reverse the inequality signs: 15 \u2265 n \u2265 -13.\n15 \u2265 n \u2265 -13\n15 \u2265 n \u2265 -13 \n\nSince the number of nickels cannot be negative, we can eliminate the -13 part of the inequality.\n15 \u2265 n",
