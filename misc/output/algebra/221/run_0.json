    "problem": "The height of a ball when it is thrown off a cliff can be represented by the equation $h=45-7t-6t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds. In how many seconds will the ball reach a height of 25 feet?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we plug in 25 for $h$, we get \\begin{align*} 25& =45-7t-6t^2\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6t^2+7t-20& =0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (3t-4)(2t+5)& =0\n\\end{align*}The two possible values of $t$ are $\\frac43$, and $-\\frac52$. Since the time can only be a positive value, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\frac43}$.",
