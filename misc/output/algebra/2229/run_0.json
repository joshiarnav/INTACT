    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The two factors of $5x^2+nx+48$ must be in the form $(5x+A)(x+B)$. $A$ and $B$ must be positive integers to form the largest value of $n$. Therefore, $AB=48$ and $5B+A=n$. To form the largest value of $n$, $B$ must equal $48$. Therefore, $A=1$. \\[5B+A=5(48)+1=\\boxed{241}\\]",
