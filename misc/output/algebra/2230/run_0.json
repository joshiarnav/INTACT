    "problem": "If $\\lceil{\\sqrt{x}}\\rceil=15$, how many possible integer values of $x$ are there?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the expression $\\lceil{\\sqrt{x}}\\rceil$ stands for the least integer that is greater than or equal to $x$, the largest possible value of $x$ that could satisfy the equation is $15^2$, or $225$. The greatest integer smaller than $15$ is $14$, so the largest integer (smaller than $225$) that would not satisfy $\\lceil{\\sqrt{x}}\\rceil=15$ would be $14^2$, or $196$. Therefore, any integer that is in the range $196 < x \\leq 225$ could be considered a possible integer value of $x$. Since there are 29 numbers in this range, our final solution is $\\boxed{29}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Identify the range of values that satisfy the equation $\\lceil{\\sqrt{x}}\\rceil=15$, where $\\lceil{y}\\rceil$ represents the smallest integer greater than or equal to $y$.\nStep 2: Since $\\lceil{\\sqrt{x}}\\rceil=15$, it follows that $14<\\sqrt{x}\\leq15$.\nStep 3: Therefore, $14^{2}<x\\leq15^{2}$, or $196<x\\leq225$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 30.
