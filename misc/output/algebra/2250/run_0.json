    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of seconds that Jimmy takes to climb the first five flights are 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(20 + 40)/2 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{150}$.",

The sum is 150 = 20 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 40, but the next step is to add 45.\nAdd 45.\n150 + 45 = 195\nNo step is needed.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 195.",
