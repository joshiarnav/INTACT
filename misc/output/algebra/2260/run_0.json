    "solution": "Note that if $0\\le x<1$, then $\\lfloor x\\rfloor = 0$, so $f(x)=-x$. Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ includes the interval $(-1,0]$. This is in fact the whole domain; $f(x)$ can't be less than or equal to $-1$, because $x$ and $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ necessarily differ by less than $1$, and $f(x)$ can't be positive, because $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is by definition less than or equal to $x$.\n\nTherefore, the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(-1,0]}$.",
