    "solution": "By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\\pm 3/\\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\\sqrt{25-\\frac{81}{4}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\\boxed{21}$.",
