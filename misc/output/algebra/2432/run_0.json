    "solution": "Notice that multiplying all three of the original equations together tells us that $(a^2b^2c^2)/(abc) = 6$, which implies $abc=6$. Rewriting the first and third equations as $b = a^2$ and $c = \\sqrt{3a}$ and plugging these into $abc=6$ yields $a \\cdot a^2\\cdot \\sqrt{3a} = 6$. By squaring both sides of the equation, we obtain $3a^7 = 36 \\Rightarrow a = \\boxed{12^{1/7}}$.",
