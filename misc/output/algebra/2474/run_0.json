    "problem": "The fifth term of an arithmetic sequence is $11$. If the difference between two consecutive terms is $1$, what is the product of the first two terms?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Simply back up from $11$. Since $11$ is the fifth term, the first term will be $11 - 4 \\cdot 1 = 7$, and the second term will be $11 - 3\\cdot 1 = 8$. So the answer is $7 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{56}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let $a$ be the first term of the arithmetic sequence and $d$ be the common difference. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by $a + (n - 1)d$.\nStep 2: The fifth term of the arithmetic sequence is given by $a + (5 - 1)d$, which is equal to $11$. We are also given that the common difference $d$ is equal to $1$.\nStep 3: Since the fifth term of the arithmetic sequence is $11$ and the common difference is $1$, we can write the equation $a + (5 - 1)(1) = 11$. Simplifying the equation gives $a + 4 = 11$.\nStep 4: $a = 11 - 4$\n$a = 7$\nStep 5: The first term of the arithmetic sequence is $7$, and the common difference is $1$, so the second term is $7 + 1 = 8$. \nFinal Answer",
