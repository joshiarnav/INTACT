    "problem": "The number of gallons of coffee a mathematician drinks on any given day is inversely proportional to how much sleep he gets the night before. On Monday, he got 9 hours of sleep and drank 2 gallons of coffee. On Tuesday, he got 6 hours of sleep. How many gallons of coffee did he drink?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $h$ be the amount of sleep the mathematician gets and $g$ be the number of gallons of coffee he drinks. Since $g$ and $h$ are inversely proportional, that means that $gh=k$ for some constant k. From what we know about Monday, we can conclude that $k=9\\cdot2=18$. Consequently, for Tuesday we have $6g=18$, so $g=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let s = hours of sleep and c = gallons of coffee. Since s and c are inversely proportional, we have the equation cs = k, where k is a constant.\nSince s and c are inversely proportional, we have the equation cs = k, where k is a constant. We can solve for k by substituting the values of s and c from Monday: k = (9)(2) = 18.\nSubstitute the value of k and the given value of s from Tuesday into the equation cs = k.\nc = 18/6\nSimplify the expression: c = 3\nc = 18/6",
