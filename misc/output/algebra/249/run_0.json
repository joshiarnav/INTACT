    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the two integers be $x$ and $1998-x$. The product which needs to be maximized is $1998x-x^2$. Completing the square results in $-(x-999)^2+999^2$. Since $-(x-999)^2\\le 0$, the expression is maximized when $x=999$, which results in a value of $999^2=\\boxed{998001}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Let the integers be x and y. Therefore, x + y = 1998.\nStep 2:  Express y in terms of x: y = 1998 - x.\nStep 3:  The product of x and y is P = xy = x(1998 - x) = -x^2 + 1998x.\nStep 4:  To maximize P, we can find the vertex of the quadratic function P = -x^2 + 1998x. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by x = -b/(2a) = -1998 / (2*(-1)) = 999.\nStep 5:  Substitute x = 999 into P = -x^2 + 1998x to get P = -(999)^2 + 1998(999) = -998001 + 1998000 = 999.\nStep 6:  The greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 1998 is 998001.\nStep 6: The greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 1998 is 998001. \nFinal Answer",
