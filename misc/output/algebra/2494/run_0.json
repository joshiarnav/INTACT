    "solution": "In order for the equation to have to real roots, its discriminant, $b^2-4ac=(-7)^2-4(1)(-c)=49+4c$ must be greater than zero. So we have \\begin{align*}\n49+4c&>0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n4c&>-49\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nc&>\\frac{-49}{4}=-12.25.\n\\end{align*}Since $c$ must be an integer, we have $c\\ge -12$.\n\nNow we must ensure that the roots are rational. The roots are of the form $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Since $a$, $b$ and $c$ are integers, the roots are rational so long as $\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$ is rational, so we must have $b^2-4ac$ is a perfect square. Plugging in the values from our quadratic, we have $49+4c$ is a perfect square. Since $-12\\le c \\le 25$, we have $-48\\le 4c\\le 100$, so $1\\le 49+4c\\le 149$. There are $12$ possible squares between $1$ and $149$ inclusive, so we only need to check those $12$ squares to see if $c$ is an integer. But we can narrow this down further: the value of $49+4c$ must be odd, so it can only be the square of an odd integer. Thus the possible values for $49+4c$ are the squares of the odd numbers from $1$ to $11$. We solve:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccc}\n$49+4c=1$&$\\Rightarrow$&$4c=-48$&$\\Rightarrow$&$c=-12$\\\\\n$49+4c=9$&$\\Rightarrow$&$4c=-40$&$\\Rightarrow$&$c=-10$\\\\\n$49+4c=25$&$\\Rightarrow$&$4c=-24$&$\\Rightarrow$&$c=-6$\\\\\n$49+4c=49$&$\\Rightarrow$&$4c=0$&$\\Rightarrow$&$c=0$\\\\\n$49+4c=81$&$\\Rightarrow$&$4c=32$&$\\Rightarrow$&$c=8$\\\\\n$49+4c=121$&$\\Rightarrow$&$4c=72$&$\\Rightarrow$&$c=18$\n\\end{tabular}All of the values work! Their sum is $(-12)+(-10)+(-6)+0+8+18=\\boxed{-2}$.",
