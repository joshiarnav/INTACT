    "problem": "A rectangular room measures 12-feet by 6-feet. How many square yards of carpet are needed to cover the floor of the room?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The area of the room is $(12\\text{ ft.}) (6\\text{ ft.})=72$ square feet.  Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, 1 square yard equals 9 square feet.  Therefore, $72/9=\\boxed{8}$ square yards are needed to cover the floor.",

    "model_solution": "1. Convert the length and width of the room from feet to yards.\n2. Calculate the area of the room in square yards.\nMultiply the length and width of the room in yards to find the area.\n3. The area is 6 * 1.5 = 9 square yards.\n4. Round up to the nearest quarter yard to ensure enough carpet.\nNo rounding is necessary, as the area is already a whole number.\nThe area is 9 square yards.\nThe final answer is: 9",
