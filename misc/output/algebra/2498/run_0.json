    "solution": "The vertex form of a parabolic equation is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$. Since we are given that the vertex is at $(2,1)$, we know that $h=2$ and $k=1$. Plugging that into our equation gives $y=a(x-2)^2+1$. Now, substituting the other given point $(-4,-3)$ into the equation to solve for $a$, we have  \\begin{align*}\n-3&=a(-4-2)^2+1\\\\\n-4&=a(-6)^2\\\\\n-4&=36a\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{9}&=a\n\\end{align*} So the equation for the graphed parabola is $y=-\\frac{1}{9}(x-2)^2+1$. The zeros of the quadratic occur when $y=0$, so plugging that value into the equation to solve for $x$, we have $0=-\\frac{1}{9}(x-2)^2+1 \\Rightarrow (x-2)^2=9$. Taking the square root of both sides yields $x-2=\\pm 3$, so $x=5$ or $x=-1$. Thus, $m=5$ and $n=-1$, so $m-n=5-(-1)=\\boxed{6}$.",
