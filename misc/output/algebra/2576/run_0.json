    "solution": "Once all the numbers are placed in the figure, the sum of all the numbers is $2 + 3 + \\cdots + 9$. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(2 + 9)/2 \\cdot 8 = 44$. Since each of the four smallest squares have the same sum, they each have a sum of $44/4 = \\boxed{11}$.",
