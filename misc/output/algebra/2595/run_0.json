    "problem": "What is the value of $x + y$ if the sequence $2, ~6, ~10, \\ldots, ~x, ~y, ~26$ is an arithmetic sequence?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common difference of this arithmetic sequence is $6-2=4$. Since every two consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence differ by this value, $y=26-4=22$ and $x=26-2 \\cdot 4 = 18$. Hence, $x+y=22+18=\\boxed{40}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Since the given sequence is arithmetic, there is a constant difference between each pair of consecutive terms. Let's denote this common difference as $d$.\n \n*   We can find the common difference between the first two terms by subtracting the first term from the second term: \n\n$d = 6 - 2 = 4$\n\n*   Now that we have the common difference, we can find the value of $x$ by subtracting the common difference from the term that precedes $x$, which is 26.\nStep 2:  Since $x$ is the term immediately before 26, we can find its value by subtracting the common difference from 26. Therefore, $x = 26 - 4 = 22$.\nStep 3:  Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y by subtracting the common difference from x. Therefore, y = x - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{40}$",
