    "problem": "Let $f$, $g$, and $h$ be polynomials such that $h(x) = f(x)\\cdot g(x)$.  If the constant term of $f(x)$ is $-4$ and the constant term of $h(x)$ is 3, what is $g(0)$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Because $h(x) = f(x)\\cdot g(x)$, the constant term of $h$ equals the product of the constant terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.  We are told that the constant terms of $h(x)$ and $f(x)$ are 3 and $-4$, respectively.  Let the constant term of $g(x)$ be $c$.  When we evaluate $g(0)$, all terms with $x$ in them equal 0, so we are left with the constant term, $c$. Therefore, $g(0) = c$.  So, we must have $3 = (-4)\\cdot c$, from which we find $c=\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{4}}$.",

We can substitute this into the equation 3 = f(0) * g(0) to get 3 = -4 * g(0).\nStep 5: Solve for g(0) by dividing both sides of the equation 3 = -4 * g(0) by -4 to get g(0) = -3/4.\nStep 6: Final Answer",
