    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$.  Then the third term is $a + 2d = 17$, and the fifth term is $a + 4d = 39$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $2d = 22$.\n\nThen the seventh term is $a + 6d = (a + 4d) + 2d = 39 + 22 = \\boxed{61}$.",
