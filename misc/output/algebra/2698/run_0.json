    "solution": "We see that $-4$ is not in the range of $f(x) = x^2 + bx + 12$ if and only if the equation $x^2 + bx + 12 = -4$ has no real roots.  We can re-write this equation as $x^2 + bx + 16 = 0$.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \\cdot 16 = b^2 - 64$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 64 < 0$, or $b^2 < 64$.  The greatest integer $b$ that satisfies this inequality is $b = \\boxed{7}$.",

This occurs when the equation $x^2+bx+16=0$ has exactly one real solution, which happens when $b^2-4a<0$ where $a=16$, so $b^2-64<0$, which gives $b^2<64$.\nStep 3: Solve the inequality $b^2<64$.\nStep 4: $-8 < b < 8$.\nStep 5: \n$-8 < b < 8$ means $-8 < b < 8$.
