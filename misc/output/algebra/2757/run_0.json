    "problem": "What is the largest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $\\sqrt{2x}=4x$? Express your answer in simplest fractional form.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We start by squaring both sides of the equation \\begin{align*} (\\sqrt{2x})^2&=(4x)^2\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 2x&=16x^2\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 16x^2-2x&=0\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 8x^2-x&=0\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad x(8x-1)&=0\n\\end{align*}From here, we see that the two possible values of $x$ are $0$ and $\\frac18$. Since the problem only asks for the largest value of $x$, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac18}$.",
