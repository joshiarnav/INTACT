    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Factoring the denominator $x^2 + 7x - 30$, we get \\[y = \\frac{x - 3}{x^2 + 7x - 30} = \\frac{x - 3}{(x-3)(x+10)}.\\]The graph has a vertical asymptote at $x = -10$.  There is no vertical asymptote at $x = 3$, because the factors of $x - 3$ in the numerator and denominator cancel.  Therefore, the graph has $\\boxed{1}$ vertical asymptote.",
