    "solution": "The $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate of the midpoint are the averages of the $x$-coordinates and $y$-coordinates of the endpoints, respectively.  Since $4-3=1$, the $x$-coordinate of the other endpoint is $1-3=-2$.  Since $5-7=-2$, the $y$-coordinate of the other endpoint is $-2-7=-9$.
