    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We begin by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation and adding $-m-2x$ to both sides. We get $x^2+3x+(4-m)=0$. For this quadratic to have exactly one real root, the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ must be equal to $0$. Thus, we require $9-4(4-m) = 0$. Solving, we get that $m=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{4}}$.",
