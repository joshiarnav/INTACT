    "problem": "The two positive integer solutions of the equation $x^2 - mx + n = 0$ are $k$ and $t$, where $m$ and $n$ are both prime numbers and $k > t$. What is the value of $m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "From $x^2-mx+n=0$, we get $k+t=m$ and $kt=n$. Since $n$ is prime, one of $k$ and $t$ is $n$ and the other is 1. $k>t$, so $k=n$ and $t=1$. Then $m=n+1$. $m$ is also prime, so we have two consecutive integers that are prime. Since one of every two consecutive integers is even, and the only even prime is 2, we must have $n=2$ and $m=3$. Therefore, $m^n+n^m+k^t+t^k= 3^2+2^3+2^1+1^2=9+8+2+1=\\boxed{20}$.",

Let's assume $m$ and $n$ are both odd primes. Since $m$ and $n$ are both odd primes, it follows that $k$ and $t$ are both even and positive. If they are both even and positive, then their sum $k + t$ must be even, but since $m = k + t$ is a prime, it cannot be even, so $m$ cannot be an odd prime. Hence, this case is impossible.\nStep 4:\nSince $k$ and $t$ are the solutions to the equation $x^2 - mx + n = 0$, we can write the equation as $(x - k)(x - t) = x^2 - (k + t)x + kt$. Since $k + t = m$ and $kt = n$, the equation becomes $x^2 - mx + n = x^2 - mx + n$. This equation is true for all values of $x$, so we can conclude that $m$ and $n$ must be equal. However, this contradicts the fact that $m$ and $n$ are both prime numbers, which are distinct.\nStep 5:\nCase 3. Let's assume $m = 2$ and $n$ is an odd prime. We want $k$ and $t$ to be as small as possible so that $k^t$ and $t^k$ are minimized. We can use the fact that $m = k + t$ and $kt = n$ to find the possible values of $k$ and $t$.\n\nHowever, since the solution was already found in the previous steps, the correct final answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{2 + 2 + 3 + 9 = 16}$",
