    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Summing all three equations yields that $5a + 5b + 5c = -3 + 9 + 19 = 25$. Thus, $a + b + c = 5$. Subtracting this from each of the given equations, we obtain that $2a = -8, 2b = 4, 2c = 14$. Thus, $a = -4, b = 2, c =7$, and their product is $abc = -4 \\times 2 \\times 7 = \\boxed{-56}$.",
