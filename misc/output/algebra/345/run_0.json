To do this, we divide the numerator, 15, by the denominator, 4. This gives us 3 with a remainder of 3. Hence, $-\\frac{15}4$ can be expressed as $-3\\frac34$.\nStep 2:  The greatest integer less than the mixed number $-3\\frac34$ is the greatest integer less than $-3$ since $\\frac34$ is greater than 0.\nStep 2:  The greatest integer less than $-3$ is $\\boxed{-4}$.\nStep 2: The greatest integer less than $-3$ is $\\boxed{-4}$.\nStep 2: The greatest integer less than $-3$ is $\\boxed{-4}$.",
