    "solution": "If we substitute $f^{-1}(x)$ into our expression for $f$ we get  \\[f(f^{-1}(x))=4(f^{-1}(x))^3+1.\\]This reduces to  \\[x=4(f^{-1}(x))^3+1.\\]If we solve for $f^{-1}(x)$, we find that $f^{-1}(x)=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{x-1}{4}}$. Therefore, $f^{-1}(33)=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{33-1}{4}}=\\sqrt[3]8=\\boxed{2}$.",
