    "problem": "What is the minimum possible value for $y$ in the equation $y = x^2 - 6x + 13$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Write $x^2-6x$ as $(x-3)^2-9$ to obtain  \\[\ny=(x-3)^2+4.\n\\]Since $(x-3)^2\\geq0$, we have $y\\geq\\boxed{4}$.  The value $y=4$ is obtained when $x=3$. (Note: this method of rewriting a quadratic expression is called ``completing the square'').",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Rewrite the equation in vertex form by completing the square to find the vertex of the parabola.\n$y = x^2 - 6x + 13$\n$y = (x^2 - 6x + 9) - 9 + 13$\n$y = (x - 3)^2 + 4$\nStep 2: The vertex form of a parabola is $(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex. Since the vertex form is $y = (x - 3)^2 + 4$, the vertex of the parabola is $(3, 4)$.\nThe vertex form of a parabola is $(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex. Since the minimum value of a parabola occurs at its vertex, the minimum possible value for $y$ is $k$. Since the vertex of the parabola is $(3, 4)$, the minimum value for $y$ is 4.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.",
