    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the fifth term is halfway between the first term and ninth term, it is simply the average of these terms, or \\[\\frac{2/3 + 4/5}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{15}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let $a$ be the first term and $d$ be the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. We are given that $a=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $a+8d=\\frac{4}{5}$.\nStep 2: We can substitute $a = \\frac{2}{3}$ into the second equation to solve for $d$: $\\frac{2}{3} + 8d = \\frac{4}{5}$.",
