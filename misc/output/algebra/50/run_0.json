    "problem": "The roots of the equation $2x^2-mx+n=0$ sum to 6 and multiply to 10. What is the value of $m+n$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$, the roots sum to $\\frac{-b}{a}$ and multiply to $\\frac{c}{a}$. Therefore, in the equation $2x^2-mx+n=0$, the roots sum to $\\frac{m}{2}=6$ and multiply to $\\frac{n}{2}=10$. Solving the first equation, we see that $m=12$ and solving the second equation, we see that $n=20$. Therefore, $m+n=12+20=\\boxed{32}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of the equation. The sum of the roots is $r_1+r_2=6$. The product of the roots is $r_1\\cdot r_2=10$.\nStep 2: The equation $2x^2-mx+n=0$ can be rewritten using Vieta's formulas as $x^2-3x+5=0$, which matches the sum and product of the roots.\n\n Final Answer",
