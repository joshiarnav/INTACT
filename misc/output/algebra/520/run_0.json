    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Completing the square, we get $(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\\boxed{(1, 2)}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Rewrite the given equation in standard form by completing the square for both the x and y terms. This gives $x^2-2x+1+y^2-4y+4=33$.\nStep 2: Factor the left-hand side of the equation as the square of a binomial to get $(x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 33$.\nStep 3: The equation of a circle with center $(h, k)$ and radius $r$ is given by $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$. Therefore, the center of the circle with equation $(x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 33$ is $(1, 2)$.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(1, 2)}$",
