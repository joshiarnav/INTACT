    "problem": "What is the smallest positive four-digit integer that is the product of two consecutive integers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We look for the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $n(n+1)$ is greater than 999.  We expect this value of $n$ to be near $\\sqrt{1000}$, which is between 31 and 32. Trying $n=31$, we find that $31(32)=992$. Adding 1 gives us $n=32$ and $32(33)=\\boxed{1056}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the smallest possible consecutive integers that can be multiplied to form a four-digit number.\nStep 2: Identify the consecutive integers as 30 and 31, since 30 * 31 = 930, which is less than 1000, and 31 * 32 = 992, which is still less than 1000, but 32 * 33 = 1056, which is a four-digit number.\nStep 3: Since 32 * 33 = 1056 is the smallest four-digit number that is the product of two consecutive integers, the answer is 1056.\nSince 32 * 33 = 1056 is the smallest four-digit number that is the product of two consecutive integers, the answer is 1056.
