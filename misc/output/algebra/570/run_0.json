    "solution": "Instead of expanding the entire product, we can look only at terms that will multiply to give $x^3$.  We know that: $$x^3=x^3\\cdot 1=x^2\\cdot x=x\\cdot x^2=1\\cdot x^3$$Knowing this, the $x^3$ term in the expansion will be the sum of these four terms: $$(-3x^3)(4)+(-3x^2)(3x)+(-8x)(-7x^2)+(1)(2x^3)$$We simplify to find: \\begin{align*}\n&(-3x^3)(4)+(-3x^2)(3x)+(-8x)(-7x^2)+(1)(2x^3)\\\\\n&\\qquad=-12x^3-9x^3+56x^3+2x^3\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\boxed{37}x^3\n\\end{align*}",
