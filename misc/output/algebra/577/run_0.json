    "problem": "For how many positive integer values of $x$ is $x^{-1}>x$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Suppose $x$ is positive and satisfies $x^{-1}>x$. Because $x$ is positive, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $x$ to obtain $1 > x^2$, an inequality which is clearly false for all positive integers $x$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{0}$ positive integer solutions.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Multiply both sides by x to clear the fraction, obtaining x^2 < 1.\nStep 2: Since x^2 < 1, take the square root of both sides. This gives x < 1 or x > -1.\nStep 3: Since x is a positive integer, x cannot be -1. Thus, the inequality becomes x < 1.\nStep 4: Since x is a positive integer, the values that satisfy x < 1 are x = 1. However, the original problem requires x^{-1}>x, and when x = 1, 1^{-1}=1, which does not satisfy the original inequality. Therefore, there are no positive integer values of x that satisfy x^{-1}>x.
