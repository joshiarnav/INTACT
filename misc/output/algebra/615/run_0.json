    "problem": "Bob can travel $m$ miles in $h$ hours on his bicycle. At this rate, how many hours would it take him to travel $h$ miles? Express your answer in terms of $m$ and $h$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since Bob travels $m$ miles in $h$ hours, he travels $m/h$ miles in 1 hour.  Therefore, in order to travel $h$ miles, he must travel for $h/(m/h) = \\boxed{\\frac{h^2}{m}}$ hours.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: We need to find the rate at which Bob travels on his bicycle. To do this, we will divide the distance he can travel by the time it takes him to travel that distance. rate = distance / time = m / h\nStep 2: To find the time it would take Bob to travel $h$ miles, we can divide the distance $h$ by his rate $m/h$. time = distance / rate = h / (m/h)\nStep 3: \nh / (m/h) = h^2 / m\nStep 4: \nh^2 / m = h^2 / m\nStep 4: \nh^2 / m = h^2 / m",
