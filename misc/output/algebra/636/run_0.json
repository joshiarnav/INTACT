    "problem": "A parabola with equation $y=x^2+bx+c$ passes through the points $(2,3)$ and $(4,3)$. What is $c$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We substitute these two points into the given equation to solve for $c$. Plugging in $(2,3)$, we get $3=2^2+2b+c\\Rightarrow 2b+c=-1$. Plugging in $(4,3)$, we get $3=4^2+4b+c \\Rightarrow 4b+c=-13$. In summary, we have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n2b+c&=-1\\\\\n4b+c&=-13\n\\end{align*} Multiplying the first equation by 2, we have $4b+2c=-2$. Subtracting the second equation from this last one, we have $(4b+2c)-(4b+c)=-2-(-13) \\Rightarrow c=\\boxed{11}$.\n\nThe parabola is graphed below: [asy]\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(6);\n\nxaxis(0,6,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nyaxis(0,12,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn x^2-6x+11;\n}\n\ndraw(graph(f,0,6), Arrows(4));\n[/asy]",
