    "problem": "If a school bus leaves school with 48 students on board, and one-half of the students get off the bus at each of the first three stops, how many students remain on the bus after the third stop?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "At each stop, the number of students on the bus is cut in half. Therefore, after 3 stops, the number of students on the bus is $48(\\frac12)^3 = \\frac{48}8 = \\boxed{6}$.",
