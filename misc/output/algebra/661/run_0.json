    "problem": "Suzanne walks four miles every third day. What is the fewest number of miles she can walk in February?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "February has 28 days with one extra day during leap years. We want the fewest number of miles, so we go with 28 days in February. The fewest number of days she can walk is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{28}{3}\\right\\rfloor=9$. So the fewest number of miles she can walk is $9\\cdot4=\\boxed{36}$ miles.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "List the days of February and determine how many days she can walk four miles.\nDetermine how many days in February are divisible by 3.\nFind the date of the last day in February that is divisible by 3 and calculate the miles walked on that day.\nFind the total number of miles walked on the days divisible by 3.\nFind the total number of miles walked on the days divisible by 3.",
