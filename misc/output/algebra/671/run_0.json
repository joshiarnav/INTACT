    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common ratio is $\\frac{6x}{2} = 3x$; that is, each term is obtained by multiplying $3x$ to the previous term. The next term is thus $54x^3 \\cdot 3x = \\boxed{162x^4}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Identify the common ratio of the geometric sequence\nThe common ratio can be found by dividing each term by its preceding term. So, we have $\\frac{6x}{2} = 3x$, $\\frac{18x^2}{6x} = 3x$, and $\\frac{54x^3}{18x^2} = 3x$.\n\n## Step 2:  Determine the pattern of the sequence\nSince the common ratio is a constant $3x$ in this case, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by $3x$.",
