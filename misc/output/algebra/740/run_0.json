    "problem": "Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. If it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, using the same rates, how many minutes would it take Jordan to run 5 miles?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Determine the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles.\nSteve ran 3 miles in 24 minutes, so Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. \nTime for Steve to run 3 miles = 24 minutes, so time for Jordan to run 2 miles = 24/2 minutes = 12 minutes.\nStep 2:  Determine Jordan's rate per mile.\nJordan ran 2 miles in 12 minutes, so Jordan's rate per mile = 2 miles / 12 minutes = 1/6 miles/minute.\nStep 3:  Determine the time it would take Jordan to run 5 miles.\nTime = Distance / Rate = 5 miles / (1/6 miles/minute) = 30 minutes.\nStep 4:  Check the units in the solution.\nThe final answer is: Final Answer",
