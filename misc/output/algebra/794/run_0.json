    "problem": "A stack of 100 nickels has a height of 6.25 inches. What is the value, in dollars, of an 8-foot stack of nickels? Express your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The height of each nickel is $6.25/100=0.0625$ inches.  Divide 8 feet by 0.0625 inches to find that there are $\\frac{8\\cdot 12}{0.0625}=1536$ nickels in an 8-foot stack.  The value of 1536 nickels is $1536\\times \\$0.05=\\boxed{\\$76.80}$.",
