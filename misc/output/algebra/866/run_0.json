    "solution": "The vertical asymptotes will occur when the denominator of a simplified rational expression is equal to zero. We factor the denominator $3x^2+5x+2$ to obtain $(3x+2)(x+1)$.  Hence, there are vertical asymptotes when $x=-1,-\\frac{2}{3}$, and the sum of these values of $x$ is $-1-\\frac{2}{3}=\\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}.}$\n\n(We can also use Vieta's formulas, which states that the sum of the roots of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$.)",
