    "problem": "A parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ has a vertical line of symmetry at $x=2$ and goes through the two points $(1,1)$ and $(4,-1)$. The quadratic $ax^2 + bx +c$  has two real roots. The greater root is $\\sqrt{n}+2$. What is $n$?",

    "solution": "We rewrite the equation of the parabola as $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants and $(h,k)$ are the coordinates of the vertex. If the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at $x=2$, then the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=2$, so $h=2$. The equation of the parabola becomes $y=a(x-2)^2+k$. Plugging in the two given points into this equation, we have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n1&=a(1-2)^2+k \\Rightarrow 1=a+k\\\\\n-1&=a(4-2)^2+k \\Rightarrow -1=4a+k\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second yields $-2=3a$, so $a=-2/3$. Plugging this value into the first equation to solve for $k$, we find that $k=5/3$. So the equation of the parabola is $y=-\\frac{2}{3}(x-2)^2+\\frac{5}{3}$. To find the zeros of the parabola, we set $y=0$ and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n0&=-\\frac{2}{3}(x-2)^2+\\frac{5}{3}\\\\\n\\frac{2}{3}(x-2)^2 &= \\frac{5}{3}\\\\\n(x-2)^2 &= \\frac{5}{2}\\\\\nx &= \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}+2\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe greater zero is at $x=\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}+2$, so $n=\\boxed{2.5}$. The graph of the parabola is below:\n\n[asy]\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(0,4,Ticks(f, 1.0));\n\nyaxis(-1,2,Ticks(f, 1.0));\n\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn -2/3*(x-2)^2+5/3;\n\n}\n\ndraw(graph(f,0,4));\n[/asy]",
