    "solution": "Note that if the the two series have constant ratios of $a$ and $b,$ respectively, then $4\\left( \\frac{12}{1-a} \\right) = \\frac{12}{1-b}.$ Simplifying, $4(1-b)=1-a.$ Substituting in $a= \\frac{4}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}$ and $b= \\frac{4+n}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{n}{12},$ we quickly find that $n=\\boxed{6}.$",
