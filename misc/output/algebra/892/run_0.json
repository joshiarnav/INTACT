Therefore, the line portion of the graph must have positive slope, because it must intersect horizontal lines which lie below the $x-$axis. Thus, $a > 0.$\n\nFor $a > 0,$ the line portion of the graph passes through all horizontal lines with height less than or equal to $a^2+2a,$ and the parabola portion of the graph passes through all horizontal lines with height greater than or equal to $a^3.$ Therefore, all horizontal lines are covered if and only if \\[a^2 + 2a \\ge a^3.\\]Since $ a > 0,$ we can divide by $a$ to get \\[a + 2 \\ge a^2,\\]so $0 \\ge a^2 - a - 2 = (a-2) ( a+1).$ This means that $-1 \\le a \\le 2,$ so the greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{2}.$\n\nThe graph of $y = f(x)$ for $a = 2$ is shown below (not to scale); note how the parabola and line meet at one point: [asy]\nsize(8cm);\nimport graph;\n\nreal a =2;\ndraw((-5,0)--(6,0),EndArrow());\ndraw((0,-6)--(0,14),EndArrow());\n\nreal g(real x) {return 0.5*a*(x-a)^2+a^3;}\nreal f(real x) {return a*x+2*a;}\n\ndraw(graph(f,-4.6,a),BeginArrow());\ndraw(graph(g,a,4.5),EndArrow());\n\nlabel(\"$f(x)$\",(0,15.5));\nlabel(\"$x$\",(6,0),E);\ndot((2,8));\n[/asy]",
