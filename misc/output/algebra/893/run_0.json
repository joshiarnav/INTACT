    "problem": "The product of $3t^2+5t+a$ and $4t^2+bt-2$ is $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. What is $a+b$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The constant term of the product of two polynomials is just the product of the two constant terms. Therefore we know that $6=-2a$, so $a=-3$. We now consider the linear term of the product of our polynomials. It's given by $-16t=(5t\\cdot-2)+a\\cdot bt\\Longrightarrow-16t=-10t+(-3)bt\\Longrightarrow b=2$. Therefore our answer is $a+b=\\boxed{-1}$.",
