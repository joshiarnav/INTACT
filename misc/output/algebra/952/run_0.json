    "problem": "What is the ordered pair of real numbers $(x, y)$ which satisfies the equation $|x+ y-7|+ |4x - y+ 12|= 0$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, we must have that $x + y - 7 = 0$ and $4x - y + 12 = 0$.  Adding these equations together, we find $x = -1$.  Thus $y = 8$, and the desired answer is $\\boxed{(-1,8)}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  We start by analyzing the given equation, which involves absolute values. We have the equation $|x+ y-7|+ |4x - y+ 12|= 0.$\nThe first step in solving this equation is to consider the cases based on the signs of the absolute value expressions.\nStep 2:  Case 1: $x + y - 7 \\ge 0$ and $4x - y + 12 \\ge 0$\nIn this case, we have the equation $x + y - 7 + 4x - y + 12 = 0.$\nStep 2: Simplify the equation to obtain $5x + 5 = 0$, and then solve for $x$ to get $x = -1$.\nStep 3:  Substituting $x=-1$ into the equation $x + y - 7 = 0$, we get $-1 + y - 7 = 0$, and solving for $y$, we obtain $y = 8$.\nStep 4:  Since we found the solution $x = -1$ and $y = 8$ in case 1, we need to check if it satisfies the conditions of this case. We have $x + y - 7 \\ge 0$, which gives $(-1) + 8 - 7 = 0$, and $4x - y + 12 \\ge 0$, which gives $4(-1) - 8 + 12 = 0$. Since both conditions are satisfied, it is a valid solution.\nCase 2: $x + y - 7 < 0$ and $4x - y + 12 < 0$\nIn this case, we have the equation $-(x + y - 7) - (4x - y + 12) = 0.$\nStep 3: Simplify the equation to obtain $-x - y + 7 - 4x + y - 12 = 0$, which reduces to $-5x - 5 = 0$.\nSolve $-5x - 5 = 0$ to get $x = -1$.\nStep 4: \nSubstituting $x=-1$ into the equation $4x - y + 12 = 0$, we get $4(-1) - y + 12 = 0$, which simplifies to $-4 - y + 12 = 0$. Solving for $y$, we obtain $y = 16$.\nSubstitute x = -1 and y = 16 into the equation x + y - 7 + 4x - y + 12 = 0 to check if it satisfies the conditions of this case.",
