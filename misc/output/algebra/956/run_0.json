    "solution": "Let the two integers be $n$ and $n + 1,$ so $n(n + 1) < 400.$  Then the largest possible value of $n$ will be close to the square root of 400, which is $\\sqrt{400} = 20.$  For $n = 19,$ $n(n + 1) = 19 \\cdot 20 = 380,$ and for $n = 20,$ $n(n + 1) = 20 \\cdot 21 = 420,$ so the largest possible sum of two consecutive integers whose product is less than 400 is $19 + 20 = \\boxed{39}.$",

The solution is -21 < x < 20.\nStep 5: The greatest of the two consecutive integers is x + 1, so the greatest possible sum is 2x + 1. Since x must be less than 20, the greatest possible sum is 39.\nStep 6: Since the greatest possible value of x is 20, substitute this value into the expression 2x+1 to find the greatest possible sum. 2(20) + 1 = 41.\nStep 6: Since the greatest possible value of x is 20, substitute this value into the expression 2x+1 to find the greatest possible sum.\nStep 6: The greatest possible sum is 41.\nStep 6: The greatest possible sum is 41.",
