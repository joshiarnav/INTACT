    "solution": "We begin by moving the second inequality to the right side of the equation, giving us $|x+5|=|3x-6|$. From here, we can split the equation into two separate cases.  For the first case, note that if $x+5$ and $3x-6$ have the same sign, then $x+5=3x-6$:\n\nCase 1: \\begin{align*} x+5&=3x-6\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad -2x&=-11\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=\\frac{11}{2}\n\\end{align*}If we plug this value of $x$ back into the original equation to check our answer, we get that $\\left|\\frac{11}{2}+5\\right|-\\left|3\\left(\\frac{11}{2}\\right)-6\\right|=0$ or $0=0$. Since this is true, we can accept $x=\\frac{11}{2}$ as a valid solution.\n\nFor case two, note that if $x+5$ has a different sign than $3x-6$, then $x+5=-(3x-6)$.\n\nCase 2: \\begin{align*} x+5&=-(3x-6)\n\\\\ x+5&=-3x+6\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 4x&=1\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=\\frac{1}{4}\n\\end{align*}If we plug this value of $x$ back into the original equation to check our answer, we get that $\\left|\\frac{1}{4}+5\\right|-\\left|3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)-6\\right|=0$, which also gives us $0=0$. This is always true, so we can accept $x=\\frac{1}{4}$ as a valid solution as well. Thus, our two possible solutions are $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{11}{2}$. Since the question asks for the largest possible value of $x$, our final solution is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{2}}$.",
