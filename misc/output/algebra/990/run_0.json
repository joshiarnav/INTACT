    "problem": "When Frederick was born, his grandparents gave him a gift of $\\$2000$, which was invested at a simple interest rate of $5\\%$ per year.  How much money will Frederick have when he can collect the money at the age of $18$?  (Assume no money is added to the account besides the interest.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the interest is simple, then Frederick's money grows by $\\allowbreak .05(2000)=100$ dollars per year.  This means he gained $18\\times100=\\$1800$, so he has a total of $2000+1800=\\boxed{\\$3800}$.",
