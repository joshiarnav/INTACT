    "problem": "Bill can buy jags, jigs and jogs for $\\$1$, $\\$2$ and $\\$7$ each, respectively. What is the largest number of jogs he can purchase if he must buy at least one of each item and will spend exactly $\\$50$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Bill cannot purchase 7 jogs, because then he would only have one dollar left over and could not purchase at least one jag and one jig as well.  However, Bill can purchase $\\boxed{6}$ jogs if, for example, he also purchases 2 jags and 3 jigs.",
    "is_solved": false,
    "model_solution": "Let $x$ be the number of jags, $y$ be the number of jigs, and $z$ be the number of jogs. Bill can spend $\\$50$, so $x+2y+7z=50$. Bill must buy at least one of each item, so $x \\ge 1$, $y \\ge 1$, and $z\\ge 1$.\nSince $x+2y+7z=50$, we can rewrite this equation as $x+2y=50-7z$. Since $x \\ge 1$ and $y \\ge 1$, it follows that $x+2y \\ge 3$.\nSince $x+2y \\ge 3$, we have $50-7z\\ge 3$ or $-7z\\ge -47$ or $z\\le\\frac{47}{7}$\nSince $z\\le\\frac{47}{7}$, since $z$ is an integer, we can conclude that $z\\le6$.\nSince $z \\le 6$ and $z$ is an integer, we know that $z \\le 6$\nSince $x+2y=50-7z$, and $50-7z\\ge 3$, it follows that $50-7z$ is a multiple of $3$. The possible values of $z$ are $z=1,2,3,4,5,6$. We need to test each value of $z$.\nSince $x+2y=50-7z$, and $z=1,2,3,4,5,6$, we have the possible equations $x+2y=43,36,29,22,15,8$. We need to find the largest value of $z$ for which there are integral values of $x,y$ satisfying these equations. We start with $z=6$, which gives $x+2y=8$.\nSince $x+2y=8$, we have two possible solutions: $x=0$ and $y=4$, or $x=2$ and $y=3$.\nSince $x=0$ and $y=4$ is not valid because it doesn't meet the conditions $x\\ge1$ and $y\\ge1$, we consider the solution $x=2$ and $y=3$.\nSince $x=2$ and $y=3$ is a valid solution when $z=6$, and since $z=6$ is the largest value of $z$ considered, we can conclude that the largest number of jogs that Bill can purchase is 6.",
