    "problem": "Nathan will roll two six-sided dice. What is the probability that he will roll a number less than three on the first die and a number greater than three on the second die? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "For the first die to be less than three, it must be a 1 or a 2, which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$. For the second die to be greater than 3, it must be a 4 or a 5 or a 6, which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of both of these events occuring, as they are independent, is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
