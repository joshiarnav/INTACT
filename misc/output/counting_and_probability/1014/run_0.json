    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We first place the non-math books. There are $4$ choices for the first book, $3$ choices for the second book, $2$ choices for the third book, and $1$ choice for the last book. Then we have to put the two math books between the four non-math books such that there is at least one non-math book between the two math books. We see there is a total of $5$ openings created by the four non-math books. So the first math book has $5$ choices, and the second math book has $4$ choices.\n\nSo the total number of ways the books can be placed is $4\\times3\\times2\\times1\\times5\\times 4 =\\boxed{480}.$",

Therefore, we have 5 units (the two math books as one, and the other 4 books) that we can arrange in 5! = 120 ways. However, the two math books can be arranged between themselves in 2! = 2 ways. Thus, there are 120 * 2 = 240 ways to stack all 6 books with the two math books together.\n\nNote: This step was not explicitly requested to be combined with the final answer, so it is presented as is.",
