    "problem": "My school's math club has 6 boys and 8 girls.  I need to select a team to send to the state math competition.  We want 6 people on the team.  In how many ways can I select the team to have more girls than boys?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We do this problem with three cases.\n\nCase 1: 4 girls, 2 boys on the team.\n\nWith 4 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to pick the boys, for a total of $70 \\times 15 = 1050$.\n\nCase 2: 5 girls, 1 boy on the team.  With 5 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to pick the boy, for a total of $56 \\times 6 = 336$.\n\nCase 3: 6 girls on the team. With 6 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$ ways to pick the girls on the team.\n\nThis gives us a sum of $1050 + 336 + 28 = \\boxed{1414}$.",

Then, find the number of ways to select 4 girls out of 8, which is C(8,4) = 70. Multiply these two values to get 15*70 = 1050.\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to select 1 boy and 5 girls.\nFirst, find the number of ways to select 1 boy out of 6, which is C(6,1) = 6. Then, find the number of ways to select 5 girls out of 8, which is C(8,5) = 56. Multiply these two values to get 6*56 = 336.\n\nCalculate the number of ways to select 0 boys and 6 girls.\nFirst, find the number of ways to select 0 boys out of 6, which is C(6,0) = 1. Then, find the number of ways to select 6 girls out of 8, which is C(8,6) = 28.
