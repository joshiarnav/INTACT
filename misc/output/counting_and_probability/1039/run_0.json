    "solution": "Since $\\angle APB = 90^{\\circ}$ if and only if $P$ lies on the semicircle with center $(2,1)$ and radius $\\sqrt{5}$, the angle is obtuse if and only if the point $P$ lies inside this semicircle. The semicircle lies entirely inside the pentagon, since the distance, 3, from $(2,1)$ to $\\overline{DE}$ is greater than the radius of the circle. Thus the probability that the angle is obtuse is the ratio of the area of the semicircle to the area of the pentagon.\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,D,I;\nA=(0,2);\nB=(4,0);\nC=(7.3,0);\nD=(7.3,4);\nI=(0,4);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--I--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I,W);\ndraw(A--(0,0)--B,dashed);\ndraw((3,3)..A--B..cycle,dashed);\ndot((2,1));\n[/asy] Let $O=(0,0)$, $A=(0,2)$, $B=(4,0)$, $C=(2\\pi+1,0)$, $D=(2\\pi+1,4)$, and $E=(0,4)$. Then the area of the pentagon is $$[ABCDE]=[OCDE]-[OAB] = 4\\cdot(2\\pi+1)-\\frac{1}{2}(2\\cdot4) = 8\\pi,$$and the area of the semicircle is $$\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(\\sqrt{5})^2 = \\frac{5}{2}\\pi.$$The probability is $$\\frac{\\frac{5}{2}\\pi}{8\\pi} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}.$$",
