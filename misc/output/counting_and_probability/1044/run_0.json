    "problem": "Ben rolls two fair six-sided dice. What is the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled? Express your answer as a fraction.  (If the two numbers are the same, we take that number to be the \"larger\" number.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 36 possible outcomes for the two dice. Of these, there is 1 where both dice roll a six, 5 where the first die rolls a six and the other rolls something less than a six, and 5 more where the second die rolls a six and the first die rolls something less than a six. So, there are a total of $1+5+5=11$ ways the larger number rolled can be a six. Similarly, there are $1+4+4=9$ ways the larger number rolled can be a five, $1+3+3=7$ ways the larger number rolled can be a four, $1+2+2=5$ ways the larger number rolled can be a three, $1+1+1=3$ ways the larger number rolled can be a two, and $1$ way the larger number rolled can be a one. The expected value of the larger number is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{36}(11(6)+9(5)&+7(4)+5(3)+3(2)+1(1))\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{36}(66+45+28+15+6+1)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{161}{36}}\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  First, we need to understand the possible outcomes when rolling two fair six-sided dice. Each die has six possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and since we are rolling two dice, the total number of outcomes is $6 \\times 6 = 36.$\nStep 2:  To find the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled, we can use a systematic approach. We will list all the possible outcomes, determine the larger number for each outcome, and then calculate the sum of these larger numbers.\nStep 2:  Let's consider the possible outcomes where the larger number is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can systematically count the number of ways for each outcome and calculate the sum of these larger numbers.\nStep 2:  To find the expected value, we need to find the sum of the larger number for each possible outcome.
