    "problem": "Five balls are numbered with the integers 1 through 5 and placed in a jar. Three are drawn without replacement. What is the probability that the sum of the three integers on the balls is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The sum of the three integers on the drawn balls is 15 minus the sum of the integers on the two balls that were left behind.  Therefore, we are looking for the probability that the two balls that were left behind sum to an even number.  There are $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose these two balls.  Their sum is even only if they are both even or both odd.  The probability they are both even is $\\frac{1}{10}$ and the probability that they are both odd is $\\frac{3}{10}$.  In total, the probability that their sum is even is $\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{3}{10}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

This is equal to 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10.\nStep 2: Determine the number of ways to draw 3 balls out of 5 such that the sum of the integers on the balls is odd.\nStep 3: \nTo have an odd sum, we must have one even integer and two odd integers. There are 2 even integers and 3 odd integers. The number of ways to choose 1 even integer is C(2, 1) = 2, and the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers is C(3, 2) = 3. So the total number of ways is 2 * 3 = 6.\nStep 4: Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.\nP = (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of outcomes) = 6 / 10 = 3 / 5\nStep 4: \nP = (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of outcomes) = 6 / 10 = 3 / 5\nStep 5:\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$",
