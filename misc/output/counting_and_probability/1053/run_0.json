    "solution": "We calculate the complement, or the probability that Michael does not roll at least two 1's, and then subtract from 1.  If Michael does not roll at least two 1's, he must roll either zero or one.  The probability that he rolls no 1's is  $$\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6} = \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{216}$$The probability that he rolls one 1 is $$\\left(\\binom{3}{1}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6} = \\binom{3}{1}\\left(\\frac{25}{216}\\right) = \\frac{75}{216},$$since we can choose which of the dice rolled a 1 in $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways.  Thus our answer is $1-\\frac{125}{216}-\\frac{75}{216} = \\frac{16}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three fair dice. Since each die has 6 sides, there are 6^3 = 216 possible outcomes.\nStep 2: Now, let's count the number of ways Michael can roll at least two 1's. We can break this down into cases to make it easier to count: exactly two 1's, and three 1's.\nStep 3: Let's calculate the number of ways Michael can roll exactly two 1's. This means two of the dice must show a 1, and the remaining die must show any of the other five numbers. There are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways to choose which two dice will show a 1, and for each of these, there are 5 choices for the remaining die (since it cannot show a 1). So, there are $3\\cdot 5=15$ ways to roll exactly two 1's. Additionally, there is only 1 way to roll three 1's since all three dice must show a 1. Therefore, the total number of ways to roll at least two 1's is $15+1=16$.\nStep 4: The probability of rolling at least two 1's is the number of ways to roll at least two 1's divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is $\\frac{16}{216}$.\nStep 5: Simplify the fraction $\\frac{16}{216}$.\nFind the greatest common divisor of 16 and 216, and divide both the numerator and denominator by this value.\nStep 6: The greatest common divisor of 16 and 216 is 16. Divide both the numerator and denominator by 16 to get $\\frac{1}{18}$.\nStep 7: Since the probability must be expressed as a common fraction, and we already have it in this form, no further action is required.\nStep 4: The probability of rolling at least two 1's is the number of ways to roll at least two 1's divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is $\\frac{16}{216}$.",
