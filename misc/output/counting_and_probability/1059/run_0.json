    "solution": "Let $a$ be the number of elements in set $A$ and $b$ be the total number of elements in set $B$. We are told that the total number of elements in set $A$ is twice the total number of elements in set $B$ so we can write  $$a=2b.$$ Since there are 1000 elements in the intersection of set $A$ and set $B$, there are $a-1000$ elements that are only in set $A$ and $b-1000$ elements only in set $B$. The total number of elements in the union of set $A$ and set $B$ is equal to $$\\mbox{elements in only }A+\\mbox{elements in only }B+\\mbox{elements in both}$$ which we can also write as  $$(a-1000)+(b-1000)+1000.$$ Because we know that there is a total of 3011 elements in the union of $A$ and $B$, we can write  $$(a-1000)+(b-1000)+1000=3011$$ which simplifies to $$a+b=4011.$$  Because $a=2b$ or $b=\\frac{1}{2}a$, we can write the equation in terms of $a$ and then solve for $a$. We get  \\begin{align*}\na+b&=4011\\qquad\\implies\\\\\na+\\frac{1}{2}a&=4011\\qquad\\implies\\\\\n\\frac{3}{2}a&=4011\\qquad\\implies\\\\\na&=2674\\\\\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the total number of elements in set $A$ is $\\boxed{2674}.$",
