If nine darts land randomly on the target, how many darts would we expect to land in a non-shaded region?\n\n[asy]import graph;\nfill(Circle((0,0),15),gray(0.7));\nfill(Circle((0,0),10),white);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),20));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),15));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10));\n[/asy]",

    "solution": "The probability for a single dart to land in the non-shaded region is the ratio of the area of the non-shaded region to the area of the entire dartboard. The area of the entire dartboard is $\\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 36\\pi$. The area of the shaded region is the area of the second largest circle minus the area of the smallest circle, or $\\pi \\cdot 4^2 - \\pi \\cdot 2^2 = 12 \\pi$, so the area of the non-shaded region is $36\\pi - 12\\pi = 24\\pi$. Thus, our ratio is $\\frac{24\\pi}{36\\pi}=\\frac{2}{3}$. If each dart has a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance of landing in a non-shaded region and there are 9 darts, then the expected number of darts that land in a non-shaded region is $9 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  The first step is to calculate the areas of the different regions on the dartboard. This involves using the formula for the area of a circle, which is given by $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\nStep 2:  The large circle has a radius of 6 inches, so its area is $\\pi(6^2) = 36\\pi$ square inches. The middle circle has a radius of 4 inches, so its area is $\\pi(4^2) = 16\\pi$ square inches. The small circle has a radius of 2 inches, so its area is $\\pi(2^2) = 4\\pi$ square inches.\nStep 2:  To find the area of the non-shaded region, subtract the area of the small circle from the area of the middle circle. The area of the non-shaded region is $16\\pi - 4\\pi = 12\\pi$ square inches.\nStep 3:  Since the dartboard is uniformly colored, the probability that a dart lands in a non-shaded region is the area of the non-shaded region divided by the total area of the dartboard. This probability is $\\frac{12\\pi}{36\\pi} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nTo find the expected number of darts that land in a non-shaded region, multiply the number of darts by the probability that a dart lands in a non-shaded region.\nSince there are 9 darts and the probability of a dart landing in a non-shaded region is $\\frac{1}{3}$, the expected number of darts in a non-shaded region is $9 \\times \\frac{1}{3}$.\nSince there are 9 darts and the probability of a dart landing in a non-shaded region is $\\frac{1}{3}$, the expected number of darts in a non-shaded region is $9 \\times \\frac{1}{3}$.",
