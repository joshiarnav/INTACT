    "solution": "To meet the first condition, numbers which sum to $50$ must be chosen from the set of squares $\\{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49\\}.$ To meet the second condition, the squares selected must be different. Consequently, there are three possibilities: $1+49,$ $1+4+9+36,$ and $9+16+25.$ These correspond to the integers $17,$ $1236,$ and $345,$ respectively. The largest is $1236,$ and the product of its digits is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot6=\\boxed{36}.$",
