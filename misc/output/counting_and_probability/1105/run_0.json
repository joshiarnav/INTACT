    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people be seated in a row of chairs if three of the people, John, Wilma, and Paul, refuse to sit in three consecutive seats?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$. The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 3!$. We can arrive at $6!\\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul.  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $$8!-6!\\times 3!=8\\times 7\\times 6! - 6!\\times 3! = (8\\times 7 - 3!)6! = (50)(720)=\\boxed{36000}.$$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row of chairs without any restrictions. \n8! = 40320\nStep 2: Calculate the number of ways 8 people can be seated with John, Wilma, and Paul in consecutive seats, treating them as one unit. This is equivalent to calculating the number of ways 6 people (the 5 other people plus the 1 unit of John, Wilma, and Paul) can be seated in a row, which is 6!. Then, we multiply by 3! to account for the different arrangements of John, Wilma, and Paul within their unit. 6! * 3! = 4320.\nStep 3: Subtract the number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul can sit in consecutive seats from the total number of ways 8 people can be seated to find the number of ways the 8 people can be seated with John, Wilma, and Paul not in consecutive seats. \n40320 - 4320 = 36000\nStep 4: Final Answer",
