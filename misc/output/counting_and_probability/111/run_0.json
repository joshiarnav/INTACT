    "problem": "How many positive, three-digit integers contain at least one $3$ as a digit but do not contain a $5$ as a digit?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let us consider the number of three-digit integers that do not contain $3$ and $5$ as digits; let this set be $S$. For any such number, there would be $7$ possible choices for the hundreds digit (excluding $0,3$, and $5$), and $8$ possible choices for each of the tens and ones digits. Thus, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = 448$ three-digit integers without a $3$ or $5$.\n\nNow, we count the number of three-digit integers that just do not contain a $5$ as a digit; let this set be $T$. There would be $8$ possible choices for the hundreds digit, and $9$ for each of the others, giving $8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 9 = 648$. By the complementary principle, the set of three-digit integers with at least one $3$ and no $5$s is the number of integers in $T$ but not $S$. There are $648 - 448 = \\boxed{200}$ such numbers.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  First, we need to determine the total number of three-digit integers that do not contain the digit 5.\nFirst, we'll find the number of 100-digit integers that do not contain 5.\nStep 2:  Since the leading digit cannot be 0, there are 8 choices for the first digit (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9), and 9 choices for each of the other two digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9). Thus, the number of 100-digit integers that do not contain 5 is $8 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 648$.\n \nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{648}$",
