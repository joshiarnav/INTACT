    "solution": "The value of $x=100-2y$ is a positive integer for each positive integer $y$ with $1 \\leq y \\leq 49$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{49}$ ordered pairs of positive integers that satisfy the equation.",

Therefore, $2y$ is even and so $y$ is even.\nStep 4: Since $y$ is even, let $y=2n$ for some positive integer $n$. Then $x = 100 - 2(2n) = 100 - 4n$, so $100-4n>0$ must hold, which implies $4n<100$, so $n<25$.
