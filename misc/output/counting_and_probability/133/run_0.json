    "problem": "Erika, who is 14 years old, flips a fair coin whose sides are labeled 10 and 20, and then she adds the number on the top of the flipped coin to the number she rolls on a standard die. What is the probability that the sum equals her age in years? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum to be a 14 is for her coin flip to be a 10 and for her roll to be a 4. This can only occur in $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1:  There are two possible outcomes when Erika flips the coin: 10 or 20. For each outcome, she then rolls a standard die, which has 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, there are a total of 2 * 6 = 12 possible outcomes when Erika flips the coin and rolls the die.\nStep 2:  Erika is 14 years old, so she needs to get a sum of 14 from the coin flip and the die roll. The only way this can happen is if she flips the coin and gets a 10, then rolls a 4 on the die.\nStep 3:  The probability that she flips a 10 is 1/2, and the probability that she rolls a 4 is 1/6.\nStep 4:  The probability of both events happening is the product of the individual probabilities.\nStep 5:  (1/2) * (1/6) = 1/12\nStep 6:  Therefore, the probability that Erika will get a sum of 14 is 1/12.\nStep 7:  There is no other way for Erika to get a sum of 14, so this is the only favorable outcome.\n \nFinal Answer.",
