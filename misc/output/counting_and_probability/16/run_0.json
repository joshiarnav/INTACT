    "problem": "The letters $A, B$ and $C$ are used to form every possible three letter ``word.'' When these ``words'' are arranged in alphabetical order and numbered so that $AAA$ is Word 1 and $CCC$ is Word 27, what number will correspond to the position of word $BAB$ on the list?",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 9 possible words that start with A to begin the list, so the first word starting with B, BAA, is the 10th word. BAB is the next word after BAA, or word number $\\boxed{11}$.",

Since there are $4$ words that start with $B$ (not including the word with $A$ in the first position) and we want to find the number of the word that starts with $BA$, we have $4$ words that start with $B$ and come before $BAB$.

To find the number of the word that starts with $BA$, we count the words: $BAA$ (Word 7), $BAC$ (Word 10), $BBA$ (Word 13), $BBC$ (Word 16), and $BCC$ (Word 19). Thus, we have $7+10+13+16+19=\\boxed{65}$ words that come before $BAB$.\nStep 6: We need to add the 20 words that start with A to the 65 words that come before BAB.\nStep 7: Add the 20 words that start with A to the 65 words that come before BAB.\nStep 8: 65 + 20 = 85\nStep 9: \n85\nStep 10: \n85",
