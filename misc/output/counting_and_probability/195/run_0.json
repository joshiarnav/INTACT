    "solution": "There are only two kinds of rectangles of area 3 square units which we can form on the grid: $1\\times3$ rectangles and $3\\times1$ rectangles. For $1\\times3$ rectangles, the upper left unit square of the rectangle must be in one of the leftmost four columns and can be in any row, giving 24 possible locations. Similarly, there are 24 possible locations for a $3\\times1$ rectangle. Therefore, the total number of rectangles of area 3 which can be formed is $\\boxed{48}$.",

These rectangles have sides of length 1 and 3, so there are $6\\cdot 4 = 24$ such rectangles.\nThe number of rectangles of area $3$ square units is $36 + 16 - 24 = 28.$\nWe need to account for the fact that we double counted the rectangles with both vertical and horizontal sides.
