    "solution": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. There are 8 ways to choose the first point, 7 ways to choose the second point, and 6 ways to choose the third point, but we must divide by $3!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3!} = \\boxed{56}$.",
