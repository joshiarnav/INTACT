    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $9!$ ways to arrange 9 people in a line, however there are 9 identical rotations for each arrangement, so we divide by 9 to get $\\dfrac{9!}{9} = 8! = \\boxed{40,\\!320}$.",

Thus, each seating arrangement can be rotated to 9 different positions that are considered the same.
