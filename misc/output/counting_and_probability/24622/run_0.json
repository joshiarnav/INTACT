    "solution": "We start with the numbers that start with 1.  There are 4 ways to pick the next digit, then 3 ways to pick the third digit, 2 ways to pick the fourth, and 1 to pick the last.  Therefore, there are $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24$ integers with 1 as the first digit.  Similarly, another 24 have 2 as the first digit. That's 48 numbers so far, so we want the second smallest number that starts with 3.  The smallest is 31245, and the next smallest is $\\boxed{31254}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  We are looking for the $50^{\\text{th}}$ positive five-digit integer that uses each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 exactly once.\nStep 2:  First, we need to understand how the integers are arranged in the list. The integers are ordered from least to greatest, which means the first digit will be the smallest, and the last digit will be the largest.\nStep 3:  We also notice that the list starts with the integers beginning with 1, then 2, and so on, because each digit can be placed in only one position in each number.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we can break down the problem into cases based on the first digit of each integer.\nStep 5:  If the first digit is 1, there will be $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$ integers in this case. These are the integers from 12345 to 12354.\nStep 6:  If the first digit is 2, there will be another $24$ integers in this case. These are the integers from 21345 to 21354\nStep 7:  Similarly, we can calculate the total number of integers for the cases starting with 3 and 4.\nStep 2:\nTo find the $50^{\\text{th}}$ integer, we need to find the remaining integers in the cases starting with 1 and 2, and then determine where the $50^{\\text{th}}$ integer falls in the case starting with 3.\nStep 3:  Since we have already calculated that there are 24 integers in each case starting with 1 and 2, we know that the first 48 integers in the list are either beginning with 1 or 2. Therefore, the $50^{\\text{th}}$ integer must begin with 3.\nStep 4:  Now, let's calculate the number of integers that start with 3. When the first digit is 3, the remaining four digits can be arranged in $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$ ways. However, we need to find the $50^{\\text{th}}$ integer, so we need to determine where it falls within the $24$ possible arrangements of the remaining digits.\nStep 4:  Since we need to find the $50^{\\text{th}}$ integer, and there are $48$ integers in the cases starting with 1 and 2, the $50^{\\text{th}}$ integer is the first integer starting with 3. This means we're looking for the first integer in the case starting with 3.\nStep 5:  The first integer starting with 3 is 31542.\nStep 5: The first integer in this case, when the first digit is 3, is 31524.\nStep 6:  The first integer in this case, when the first digit is 3, is 31524.\nThe first integer in this case, when the first digit is 3, is 31524.",
