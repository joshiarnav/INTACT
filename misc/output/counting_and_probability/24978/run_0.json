    "solution": "The probability that the teacher guesses the first student's paper correctly is $\\frac{1}{4}$.  Given that the first guess is correct, the probability that she guesses the second student's paper correctly is $\\frac{1}{3}$.  Given that both of the first two guesses were correct, the probability that she guesses the third student's paper correctly is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  If the first three are correct, then the fourth will be correct with probability $1$.  The probability that all four guesses will be correct is $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{24}}$.",
