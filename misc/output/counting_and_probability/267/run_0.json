    "problem": "Four horizontal lines and four vertical lines are drawn in a plane. In how many ways can four lines be chosen such that a rectangular region is enclosed?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In order for the four lines to enclose a rectangular region, we must choose two horizontal and two vertical lines.  If we were to choose more than two of one of these types of lines, we would not be able to enclose any region.  We can count independently the number of ways to choose vertical and horizontal lines.  There will be $\\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose horizontal lines, and the same number of ways to choose two vertical lines.  Since these are independent, there are a total of $6\\cdot 6=\\boxed{36}$ ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Identify the two types of lines involved and the conditions for selecting a set of lines to enclose a rectangle.\nStep 2: A rectangle is defined by two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. Therefore, we must choose two horizontal lines from the four available horizontal lines and two vertical lines from the four available vertical lines.\nStep 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines from the four available horizontal lines using combinations. This is denoted as C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6. Then, calculate the number of ways to choose two vertical lines from the four available vertical lines, which is also C(4,2) = 6. Multiply these two values to get the total number of combinations of lines that enclose a rectangle.\nStep 4: Multiply the number of combinations of horizontal lines by the number of combinations of vertical lines to find the total number of rectangles that can be formed, which is 6 * 6 = 36.\nStep 4: Multiply the number of combinations of horizontal lines by the number of combinations of vertical lines to find the total number of rectangles that can be formed, which is 6 * 6 = 36.",
