    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let $A$ be the area of the circular dartboard.  If the measure of a central angle of a sector is $x$ degrees, then the area of the sector is $\\left(\\frac{x}{360}\\right)A$.  The probability of the dart landing in a region is ratio of the area of the region to the area of the dartboard, so  \\[\n\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{x}{360}\\right)A}{A}.\n\\] Solve to find $x=\\boxed{60}$.",
