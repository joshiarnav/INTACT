    "problem": "Given that $x$, $\\frac{1}{x}$, $y$, $\\frac{1}{y}$, $z$ and $\\frac{1}{z}$ are all integers, how many distinct values of $x+ y+ z$ are possible?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since $x$ and $1/x$ are integers, we know that $x$ is an integer that divides 1 evenly.  Therefore, we must have $x = -1$ or $x = 1$. The same is true for $y$ and $z$. So, the possible sums are $3(-1) = -3$, $2(-1) + 1 = -1$, $2(1) + -1 = 1$ or $3(1) = 3$. So there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible values for the sum.",

Additionally, since the sum of x and y can be any integer value, and z can also be any integer value, the sum x + y + z can take any integer value.\nStep 3:  Since x , y , and z can be fractions, their sum can also be a fraction. However, because x , y , and z are restricted to be integers, the only way their sum can be a fraction is if one of x , y , or z is 1 and the others are -1. If one of x , y , or z is 1 and the others are -1, then x + y + z is 1 - 2 = -1.\nStep 4:  Because the sum of two fractions can also be a fraction, but since x , y , and z are restricted to be integers, the only fractions that can be formed are 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, and so on.\nStep 5:  Since x, y, and z can be negative, positive, or zero, and we have already considered all possible fractions, the number of distinct values of x + y + z is equal to the number of non-negative integers.\nStep 6:  There are an infinite number of non-negative integers.\nStep 7:  Since there are an infinite number of non-negative integers, and because we have already established that the sum x + y + z can take any integer value, the number of distinct values of x + y + z must also be infinite.\nStep 8:  The number of distinct values of x + y + z is infinite.\nStep 9:  The number of distinct values of $x+ y+ z$ is infinite.\nStep 10: \nThere are an infinite number of non-negative integers.",
