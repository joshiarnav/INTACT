    "problem": "If the six digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5 and 8 are randomly arranged into a six-digit positive integer, what is the probability that the integer is divisible by 15? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "By the fact that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, any arrangement of the digits will be a multiple of 3. To be a multiple of 5, the number must end in one of the fives, which will happen with probability $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. Since any number that is a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5 is a multiple of 15, the probability of it being a multiple of 15 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

A number is divisible by 15 if it is divisible by both 3 and 5.\nStep 2:  For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. In our case, the sum of the given digits is $1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 8 = 24$, which is divisible by 3. This means any arrangement of the digits will result in a number that is divisible by 3.\nStep 3:  For a number to be divisible by 5, its last digit must be either 0 or 5. Since 0 is not present in the given digits, we must ensure that the number ends with 5. There are two 5's present in the given digits, and we need to place one of them at the end.\nStep 4:  We have 5 options for placing the second 5, as there are 5 places to put it in the remaining 5 digits.\nStep 2: The total number of possible 6-digit integers using the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, and 8 is 6!/(2!), which is equal to 360.\nStep 3: The total possible 6-digit integers is $\\frac{6!}{2!}=360$.\nStep 4: The probability that the integer is divisible by 15 is $\\frac{5}{6!/(2!)}$\nStep 5:  $\\frac{5}{360}$\n$\\frac{5}{360}$\nStep 6: $\\frac{5}{360}$\n$\\frac{5}{360}$",
