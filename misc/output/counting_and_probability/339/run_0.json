The following configuration shows that $\\boxed{12}$ points of intersection are indeed possible:\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2));\ndraw(Circle((1,1.3),2));\ndraw(Circle((-1,1.3),2));\ndraw(Circle((0,0.7),2));\n[/asy]",

There are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs of circles, so the maximum number of intersections for these pairs is $6 \\cdot 2 = 12$.\nStep 3:  The maximum number of intersections is achieved when no three circles intersect at the same point.\nStep 4:  The maximum number of intersections for all pairs of circles is 12.
