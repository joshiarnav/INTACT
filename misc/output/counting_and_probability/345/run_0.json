    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",

This occurs when one of the numbers is 2 and the other is an odd prime. There are 6 odd primes, so the sum is not even in 6 cases.\nStep 6:  Now we have identified the number of cases where the sum is not even, which is 6.\nStep 7:  Since there are 21 total possible pairs and 6 pairs with an odd sum, the number of pairs with an even sum is 21 - 6 = 15.\nStep 8:  The probability that the sum of the two numbers is even is the number of pairs with an even sum divided by the total number of possible pairs.\nStep 9: \n$\\frac{15}{21} = \\frac{5}{7}$\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$",
