    "solution": "Color the dots red and blue as shown below. Notice that whenever the ant moves, it moves from a red dot to a blue dot or a blue dot to a red dot. So since $A$ is a red dot, it must move to a blue dot, then a red dot, then a blue dot, then a red dot, and end up on a blue dot. There are only four blue dots, and the ant is equally likely to end up on any one of these four, since the diagram is symmetric to a $90^\\circ$ rotation. The probability that the ant ends on $B$ after five minutes is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.
