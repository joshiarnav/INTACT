    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First we place the $0$, which we only have four options for (everywhere but the first digit).  Then we have 4 remaining places to put the last 4 digits, two of which are not unique (the fives), so there are $\\dfrac{4!}{2!}$ options for arranging the other 4 digits.  This gives a final answer of $\\dfrac{4 \\times 4!}{2!} = \\boxed{48}$.",

We start by considering all the digits as unique, which gives us a total of $5!$ arrangements.\nStep 3:  However, we have repeated digits in the number, specifically two 5's. This means that for every arrangement that we count, we're counting it twice - once for each 5.\nStep 4:  Therefore, to correct for this overcounting, we divide the total number of arrangements by $2!$ to account for the repeated digits.\nStep 5:  Furthermore, we must also consider the restriction that the number cannot begin with 0. This means that we need to subtract the arrangements where 0 is the leading digit from the total number of arrangements.\nStep 6:  The total number of arrangements with 0 as the leading digit is $4!$, as we now have four unique digits to arrange.\nStep 7:  We need to subtract these from the total number of arrangements to obtain the final\nStep 2:  Total arrangements of 5 digits with two repeated: $\\dfrac{5!}{2!} = 60$\nTotal arrangements with 0 as the leading digit: $4! = 24$\nSubtract the total arrangements with 0 as the leading digit from the total arrangements: $60 - 24 = 36$\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",
