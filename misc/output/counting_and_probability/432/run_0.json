    "problem": "I have a drawer with 4 shirts, 5 pairs of shorts, and 6 pairs of socks in it. If I reach in and randomly remove three articles of clothing, what is the probability that I get one shirt, one pair of shorts, and one pair of socks? (Treat pairs of socks as one article of clothing.)",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First, we can find the denominator of our fraction.  There are a total of $\\dbinom{15}{3}=455$ ways to choose 3 articles of clothing out of 15. To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of clothing.  There are 4 ways we can choose a shirt, 5 ways we can choose a pair of shorts, and 6 ways we can choose a pair of socks, making a total of $4\\cdot 5 \\cdot 6=120$ ways to choose a shirt, pants, and socks so our final probability is $\\frac{120}{455}=\\boxed{\\frac{24}{91}}$.",
