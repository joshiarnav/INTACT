    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If exactly one of the triplets is in the lineup, we have 3 choices for which triplet to put in the starting lineup, and then 11 people to choose from for the remaining 5 spots.  So the answer is $3 \\times \\binom{11}{5} = 3 \\times 462 = \\boxed{1386}$.",
