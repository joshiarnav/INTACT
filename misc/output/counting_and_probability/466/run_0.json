Fix the rotation by placing the youngest Democrat in the top seat, so that we have removed the overcounting of rotations of the same arrangement.  Now there are $4!$ ways to place the remaining Democrats in the other Democratic seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in the Republican seats, for a total of $5! \\times 4! = \\boxed{2,\\!880}$ arrangements.",
