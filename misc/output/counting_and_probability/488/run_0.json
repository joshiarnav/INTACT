    "problem": "How many ways are there to put five beads on a necklace if there are eight distinct beads to choose from, and rotations and reflections of the necklace are considered the same?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Not considering rotations and reflections, there are 8 ways to choose the first bead to put on the necklace, followed by 7, 6, 5, and 4 ways to choose the next beads. For each arrangements of beads on the necklace, there are 5 ways to rotate it and another 5 ways to reflect it and then rotate it to another arrangement. Thus, arrangements of beads on the necklace come in groups of 10 equivalent arrangements. The total number of different arrangements is therefore $8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4/10=\\boxed{672}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the number of distinct arrangements of the 5 beads if the necklace were a linear sequence, without considering rotations and reflections. This can be calculated using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is P(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!. In this case, n = 8 and r = 5.\nStep 2: Divide the number of distinct arrangements (calculated in Step 1) by the total number of possible rotations of the necklace, which is equal to the length of the necklace. Since there are 8 beads, there are 8 rotations.\nStep 3: Divide the result from Step 2 by 2 to account for reflections.\nStep 4: Since the necklace has 8 beads, we need to divide the result from Step 3 by the number of rotations that leave the necklace in the same configuration, which is 8, and by 2 for the reflections, resulting in 8!/((8-5)! * 8 * 2 * 2) = (8*7*6*5*4)/(2*2) = 2*2*7*6*5*4 = 1680 / (2*2) = 420\nStep 3: Divide the result from Step 2 by 2 to account for reflections.",
