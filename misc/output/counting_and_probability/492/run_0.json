    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Adding together the percent of people who drink coffee with those who drink tea, we obtain a total of $150\\%$.  Thus, we double-counted at least $50\\%$, meaning that at least $\\boxed{50\\%}$ of adults drink both.  (The percentage who drink both ${\\it can}$ be exactly ${50\\%}$ if everybody drinks either coffee or tea; otherwise, the overlap is more than ${50\\%}$, but the problem asked for the smallest possible overlap.)",
