    "problem": "I have four identical oranges. How many ways are there for me to divide these oranges into at most three groups?  (By definition, a group must have at least one orange.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "All the oranges can go in one group, or $3$ can go in one group and $1$ in another group, or $2$ can go in one group and $2$ in another group, or $2$ can go in one group and each of the other $2$ can be in a group by itself.\n\nAs a list, we have: \\begin{align*}\n&4 \\\\\n&3,1\\\\\n&2,2\\\\\n&2,1,1.\n\\end{align*} This gives a total of $\\boxed{4}$ possibilities.",

    "model_solution": "We can break the problem into cases where the oranges are divided into 1, 2, or 3 groups.\nCase 1: One group. There is only one way to put all four oranges in one group.\nCase 2: Two groups. We can put the four oranges into two groups either 3 and 1 or 2 and 2. If the first case occurs, there is only one way to do it. If the second case occurs, there is also only one way to do it.\nCase 3: Three groups. We can put the four oranges into three groups either 1, 1, and 2 or 1, 2, and 1 or 2, 1, and 1. If any of the first three cases occur, there is only one way to do it. If the fourth case occurs, there are three ways to do it.\nSum the possibilities from each case to get the total number of ways to divide the oranges into at most three groups: 1 + (1 + 1) + (1 + 1 + 3) = 8.\nThe final answer is 8.",
