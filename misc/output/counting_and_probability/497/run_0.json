    "model_solution": "Step 1: For the 4-digit number $abcd$, where $a, b, c, d$ are digits, we know that $a$ cannot be $0$, so there are $9$ choices for $a$, and $10$ choices for each of $b, c, d$.\nStep 2: For each choice of $a$ and $b$, we can choose $c$ and $d$ in $10$ and $10$ ways, respectively, but for the choices of $c$ and $d$ to be valid, we need $a + b \\leq 9 + 9 = 18$, since $c$ and $d$ are single digits.\nStep 3: The number of choices for $a$ and $b$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^{9} i = 45$, since we can let $a = i$ and $b = 1$ for $i = 1, \\dots, 9$. For each choice of $a$ and $b$, we can choose $c$ and $d$ in $10$ and $10$ ways, respectively.\nStep 4: Therefore, the total number of such $4$-digit numbers is $(9)(10)(10)(45) = 40500$.\nStep 5:\nThe sum $a + b$ can be $0, 1, 2, \\dots, 18$, but since $c$ and $d$ are single digits, $a + b$ must be less than or equal to $9 + 9 = 18$. Thus, the sum $a + b$ can be $0, 1, 2, \\dots, 18$.\nSince $a + b$ can take values from 0 to 18, and $c$ and $d$ are single digits, we need to find how many values of $a + b$ from 0 to 18 have a corresponding digit $d$ that can be a valid last digit of the number. This is the case when $a + b \\leq 9$, since $d$ can take any value from 0 to 9. Therefore, the valid values of $a + b$ are 0, 1, 2, ..., 9.\nStep 6:\nThe number of choices for $a + b$ is $10$, and for each choice, $d$ can be chosen in $10$ ways.\nThe number of choices for $a$ is $9$, $b$ is $10$, and for each choice, $d$ can be chosen in $10$ ways if $a + b \\leq 9$.\nThe number of valid choices for $a$ and $b$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^{9} i = 45$ if $a + b \\leq 9$.\nThe number of valid choices for $a$ and $b$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^{9} i = 45$ if $a + b \\leq 9$.
