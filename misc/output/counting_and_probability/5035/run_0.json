The probability that either one arrives while the other is in the cafeteria is $40 \\%,$ and $m = a - b\\sqrt {c},$ where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.

    "solution": "Let the two mathematicians be $M_1$ and $M_2$. Consider plotting the times that they are on break on a coordinate plane with one axis being the time $M_1$ arrives and the second axis being the time $M_2$ arrives (in minutes past 9 a.m.). The two mathematicians meet each other when $|M_1-M_2| \\leq m$. Also because the mathematicians arrive between 9 and 10, $0 \\leq M_1,M_2 \\leq 60$. Therefore, $60\\times 60$ square represents the possible arrival times of the mathematicians, while the shaded region represents the arrival times where they meet.[asy] import graph; size(180); real m=60-12*sqrt(15); draw((0,0)--(60,0)--(60,60)--(0,60)--cycle); fill((m,0)--(60,60-m)--(60,60)--(60-m,60)--(0,m)--(0,0)--cycle,lightgray); draw((m,0)--(60,60-m)--(60,60)--(60-m,60)--(0,m)--(0,0)--cycle); xaxis(\"$M_1$\",-10,80); yaxis(\"$M_2$\",-10,80); label(rotate(45)*\"$M_1-M_2\\le m$\",((m+60)/2,(60-m)/2),NW,fontsize(9)); label(rotate(45)*\"$M_1-M_2\\ge -m$\",((60-m)/2,(m+60)/2),SE,fontsize(9)); label(\"$m$\",(m,0),S); label(\"$m$\",(0,m),W); label(\"$60$\",(60,0),S); label(\"$60$\",(0,60),W); [/asy]It's easier to compute the area of the unshaded region over the area of the total region, which is the probability that the mathematicians do not meet:\n$\\frac{(60-m)^2}{60^2} = .6$\n$(60-m)^2 = 36\\cdot 60$\n$60 - m = 12\\sqrt{15}$\n$\\Rightarrow m = 60-12\\sqrt{15}$\nSo the answer is $60 + 12 + 15 = \\boxed{87}$.",
