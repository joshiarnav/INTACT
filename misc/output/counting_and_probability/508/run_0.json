    "problem": "In how many ways can 6 girls and 2 boys sit in a row if the 2 boys insist on sitting next to each other?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We can consider the two boys as one person, arrange the ``seven'' people first, then arrange the 2 boys.  So the number of seating arrangements in which the boys sit together is $7!\\times 2!=\\boxed{10,\\!080}$.",
    "is_solved": false,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Consider the 2 boys as a single entity and count the total number of people as 8.\nStep 2: Find the number of ways to arrange 8 people in a row, which is 8!.\nStep 3: Since the 2 boys insist on sitting next to each other, for every arrangement of 8 people, there are 2 ways to arrange the boys within their pair. Therefore, we need to multiply the number of ways to arrange 8 people by 2.\nStep 4: Divide the total number of arrangements by 2! since the 2 boys are identical within their pair, and therefore, arrangements that are mirror images of each other should be considered the same.\nStep 5: Calculate the total number of arrangements as (8! * 2) / 2!\nStep 6: Calculate 8! as 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 40,320.\nMultiply 8! by 2 to get 80,640.\nStep 7: Divide 80,640 by 2! to get 40,320.\nStep 8: Calculate 6! as 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 720.\nStep 9: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange 6 girls as 6!.",
