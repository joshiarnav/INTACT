    "problem": "Regions $A, B, C, J$ and $K$ represent ponds. Logs leave pond $A$ and float down flumes (represented by arrows) to eventually end up in pond $B$ or pond $C$. On leaving a pond, the logs are equally likely to use any available exit flume. Logs can only float in the direction the arrow is pointing. What is the probability that a log in pond $A$ will end up in pond $B$?

The probability that a log will go from A to K to B is the probability that it will choose the middle flume initially times the probability that it will choose the flume to the right given that it chose the middle flume initially: $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}$.
