    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $11!$. Then since the I's, S's and the P's are not unique, we divide by $4!$, $4!$, and $2!$ for the arrangements of I's, S's, and P's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{11!}{4! \\times 4! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{34,\\!650}$.",
