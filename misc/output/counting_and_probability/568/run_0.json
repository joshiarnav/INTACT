    "problem": "A committee is to be made up from a group of 10 candidates. The committee must consist of a chairman and some (not necessarily nonzero) number of members-at-large. How many ways can the committee be chosen? (For example, suppose that Alex is chair while Betty, Carl, and D'Angelo make up the committee. This counts as the same as Alex being chair while Carl, Betty, and D'Angelo make up the committee. It is not the same as Betty being the chair, with Alex, Carl, and D'Angelo making up the committee. It is also not the same as Alex being chair with the committee consisting of Betty and Carl.)",

    "solution": "There are 10 ways to choose the chairman.  After choosing the chairman, we must form the rest of the committee.  For each of the other 9 candidates, we have 2 choices: either the candidate is on the committee or not.  So, the total number of ways we can form a committee with a given chairman is $2^9$.  Therefore, there are $10\\cdot 2^9 =\\boxed{5120}$ ways to form the committee.",
