    "problem": "Our club has $25$ members, and wishes to pick a president, secretary, and treasurer. In how many ways can we choose the officers, if individual members are allowed to hold $2,$ but not all $3,$ offices?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "With no restriction, the president can be any of the $25$ members, the secretary can be any of the $25$ remaining members, and the treasurer can be any of the remaining $25$ members.\n\nIf the same member holds all three offices, it could be any of the $25$ members, so there are $25$ ways for this to happen. We must exclude these $25$ possibilities, so the answer is $25\\times 25\\times 25-25=\\boxed{15,600}.$",
