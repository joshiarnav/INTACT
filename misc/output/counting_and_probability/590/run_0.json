    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The quantity $ab+c$ is even if and only if $ab$ and $c$ are both odd or both even. The probability that $c$ is odd is $\\frac{3}{5},$ and the probability that $ab$ is odd is $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25}$ (because both $a$ and $b$ must be odd).
