    "solution": "Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers.  Observe that $ab-(a+b)=(a-1)(b-1)-1$.  This quantity is non-negative unless either $a$ or $b$ equals 1.  Therefore, the only pairs of positive integers for which the sum exceeds the product are those of the form $\\{1,n\\}$ where $n$ is a positive integer.  In this case, there are 4 such pairs: $\\{1,2\\}$, $\\{1,3\\}$, $\\{1,4\\}$, and $\\{1,5\\}$.  There are a total of $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ pairs of integers, so the probability that the sum exceeds the product is $\\frac{4}{10}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

The pairs are: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\nStep 2:  The sum of the two numbers is greater than their product if and only if $x\\neq 0$ and $x+y > xy.$ This can be rewritten as $x+y > xy \\Rightarrow xy - y - x < 0 \\Rightarrow y(x-1)-x < 0 \\Rightarrow y < \\frac{x}{x-1}.$ \n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, the condition for the sum to be greater than the product is $y<\\frac{x}{x-1}$, which implies that $x$ must be at least $3$.\nStep 3:  We now find the pairs of numbers $(x,y)$ from $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ where $x \\ge 3$.
