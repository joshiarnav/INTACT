    "problem": "At a mall's food court, Crystal has $\\$7.50$ to buy a meal (one entree, one drink and one dessert). The table below lists Crystal's choices and their prices including sales tax. How many distinct possible meals can she afford to buy? \\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline\n\\text{Entrees} & \\text{Drinks} & \\text{Desserts} \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Pizza } \\$3.50 & \\text{Lemonade } \\$1.50 & \\text{Frozen Yogurt } \\$3.00 \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Corn Dog } \\$2.50 & \\text{Soda } \\$1.25 & \\text{Cookies } \\$2.00 \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Fish~\\& Chips } \\$3.50 & & \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Fried Rice } \\$4.75 & & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\\]",

    "solution": "First, notice that Crystal cannot purchase an entire meal that includes Fried Rice.  The cheapest possibility would be Fried Rice, Soda, and Cookies, which still costs 50 cents too much.  Then, looking at the Pizza option, it is not possible for Crystal to purchase Frozen Yogurt with Pizza, as that would leave only one dollar for a drink.  Thus, she can purchase 2 different meals with Pizza (Pizza, Cookies, and either drink).  Since Fish and Chips cost the same as Pizza, there are likewise 2 different possible meals with Fish and Chips.  With a Corn Dog as her entree, Crystal can buy the most expensive meal (Corn Dog, Lemonade, and Frozen Yogurt), thus, she has 4 possible meals (Corn Dog, either drink, either dessert), making for $\\boxed{8\\text{ meals}}$ total.",
