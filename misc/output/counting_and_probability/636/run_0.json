    "problem": "Pat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "It is impossible for Pat to select both 3 oranges and 6 apples, so we can calculate the probabilities of these mutually exclusive cases separately and then add to get our final answer. The probability that 3 particular pieces of fruit will be oranges and the rest will not be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^5=\\dfrac{32}{6561}$, and there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways of selecting three pieces of fruit to be the oranges so the probability that 3 will be oranges is $56\\cdot\\dfrac{32}{6561}=\\dfrac{1792}{6561}$. Similarly, the probability that 6 particular pieces of fruit will be apples and the other two won't be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^6\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{6561}$ and there are $\\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways of selecting which ones will be the apples, so multiplying again gives us a probability of $28\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{6561}=\\dfrac{112}{6561}$. Adding those two probabilities give us our final answer: $\\dfrac{1792}{6561}+\\dfrac{112}{6561}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1904}{6561}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Determine the possible combinations that satisfy the conditions. For exactly 3 oranges, the combinations are: 3 oranges, 5 other fruits (2 apples, 3 bananas). \nFor exactly 6 apples, the combinations are: 6 apples, 2 other fruits (3 oranges, \n1 banana).\nStep 2:  Calculate the total number of possible combinations. Since each piece of fruit can be one of three types, there are 3^8 = 6561 possible combinations.\nStep 3:  Calculate the probability for each case and add them together: P(exactly 3 oranges) = (8 choose 3) * (2 choose 2) * (3 choose 3) / 3^8 = 56 * 1 * 1 / 6561 = 56/6561, P(exactly 6 apples) = (8 choose 6) * (2 choose 1) * (3 choose 1) / 3^8 = 28 * 2 * 3 / 6561 = 168/6561. The probability of one or the other is (56 + 168) / 6561 = 224/6561.\nStep 4: Simplify the fraction, if necessary.\nStep 4: The fraction 224/6561 is already in its simplest form, so no further simplification is needed.
