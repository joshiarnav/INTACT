For two dice, there are 8 possible outcomes for each die, resulting in 8 * 8 = 64 possible outcomes in total.\n## Step 2: Calculate the possible outcomes and their probabilities\nEach die has 8 faces, so the probability of rolling any number on one die is 1/8. The probability of rolling any number on the second die is also 1/8.\n## Step 3: Calculate the expected value of the sum of the rolls\nTo find the expected value, calculate the sum of all the possible outcomes and their probabilities.\n\nSince the expected value of each die (E) is the sum of each possible outcome (1 through 8) multiplied by its probability (1/8), we can calculate this as:\n\\[E = \\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8}{8} \\times 2\\]\n## Step 4: Compute the expected value.\n\\[E = \\frac{36}{8} \\times 2 = 9 \\times 2 = 18\\]\n## Step 5:  The expected value of the sum of the rolls is 9 \u00d7 2 = 18.\n## Step 6:  Final Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$",
