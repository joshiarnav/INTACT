    "problem": "$a$ is chosen from the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, and $b$ is chosen from the set $\\{5,6,7,8,9\\}$. What is the probability that the product $ab$ is a prime number?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The product $ab$ is prime only when either $a$ or $b$ is one. Since $b$ cannot equal 1, $a$ must equal 1, and this occurs with probability $\\frac14$. Furthermore, $b$ must be prime, so $b$ must equal 5 or 7, and this occurs with probability $\\frac25$. Therefore, the probability that $ab$ is prime is $\\frac14\\cdot \\frac25 = \\boxed{\\frac1{10}}$.",
