    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First, we consider how many ways there are to choose three boys from eight. There are $8$ choices for the first boy, $7$ for the second, and $6$ for the third. However, because the boys are indistinct from one another, we have overcounted, and must divide by $3 \\cdot 2$. Similarly, there are $6 \\cdot 5$ ways to choose the two girls, divided by $2$ for overcounting. Thus, there are $\\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2} = \\boxed{840}$ possible quintets.",
