    "problem": "How many license plates can be formed if every license plate has 2 different letters (A through Z) followed by 2 different one digit (0-9) numbers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The first letter can be any of the 26 letters of the alphabet, while the second letter can be any of the 25 remaining letters. The first digit can be any of the 10 digits, while the second digit can be any of the 9 remaining digits. The number of license plates is $26\\times 25\\times 10\\times 9=\\boxed{58,500}$.",
