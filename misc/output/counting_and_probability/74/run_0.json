    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "No matter what the result of the first roll is, there are 6 equally likely possibilities for the second roll, only one of which is the same as the first roll.  Therefore, the probability that the dice show the same number is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
