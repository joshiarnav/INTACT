    "problem": "Nick, Janet, Huiju, and Amanda go to the World's Largest Brat Fest. Each of them is equally likely to order a meat brat, a hot dog, or a veggie brat. What is the probability that 2 of them order a meat brat, and the other two order hot dogs?",

    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that a person will order a meat brat, a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a hot dog, and a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a veggie brat. We can choose which two people we want to order meat brats in $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways, and then we want the other two to order hot dogs. Once we've set who we want to order what, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) ^4=\\frac{1}{81}$ probability that they all actually order what we want them to. Therefore, the probability that two people order meat brats and the other two hot dogs is $6\\cdot \\frac{1}{81}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$.",
