    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Of the 5 boxes with pencils, 2 have pens also, so $5-2=3$ have pencils only.  Similarly, $4-2 =2$ of the boxes have pens only:\n\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Pencils\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"Pens\", (80,74));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$2$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$3$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$2$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nThat gives us $3+2+2=7$ boxes with pens, pencils, or both.  This leaves $10-7 = \\boxed{3}$ with neither.",
