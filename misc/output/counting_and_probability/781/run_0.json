    "problem": "If $1 \\le a \\le 10$ and $1 \\le b \\le 36$, for how many ordered pairs of integers $(a, b)$ is $\\sqrt{a + \\sqrt{b}}$ an integer?",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If $\\sqrt{a+\\sqrt{b}}$ is an integer, then its square $a+\\sqrt{b}$ is also an integer.  Therefore, $\\sqrt{b}$ is an integer.  In other words, $b$ must be a perfect square.  If we define $c=\\sqrt{b}$, then the problem has asked us to find the number of ordered pairs $(a,c)$ for which $1\\leq a \\leq 10$, $1\\leq c\\leq 6$, and $a+c$ is a perfect square.  We check the 6 possibilities for $c$ separately.  If $c=1$, then $a$ is 3 or 8.  If $c=2$, then $a$ is 2 or 7.  If $c=3$, then $a$ is 1 or 6.  If $c=4$, then $a=5$, and if $c=5$, then $a=4$.  Finally, if $c=6$, then $a$ is either 10 or 3.  Altogether, there are $2+2+2+1+1+2=\\boxed{10}$ ordered pairs $(a,c)$ satisfying the given conditions.",
