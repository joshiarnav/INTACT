    "problem": "How many ways are there to arrange $6$ beads of distinct colors in a $2 \\times 3$ grid if reflections and rotations are considered the same? (In other words, two arrangements are considered the same if I can rotate and/or reflect one arrangement to get the other.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $6! = 720$ ways to put the beads on the grid ignoring distinguishability. On the other hand, there are $4$ possible transformations of the board using rotations and reflections (including the identity):\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\nA & B & C & & C & B & A\\\\\nD & E & F & & F & E & D\n\\end{tabular}\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\nF & E & D & & D & E & F\\\\\nC & B & A & & A & B & C\n\\end{tabular}None of these transformations besides the identity fixes an arrangement, so each arrangement is equivalent to three others. As a result, there are $\\tfrac{720}{4} = \\boxed{180}$ different arrangements.",

This is a permutation problem since the order of the beads matters.\nStep 3:  There are 6 distinct beads to be placed in 6 positions, so we can arrange them in $6!$ ways.\nStep 4:  However, we must consider the symmetries of rotation and reflection, as two arrangements that can be obtained by rotating or reflecting one another should be considered the same.\nStep 5:  The 2 x 3 grid has 4-fold rotational symmetry, as it can be rotated by 90 degrees three times to return to its original position. This means that for every unique arrangement, there are 4 rotations that are considered equivalent.\nStep 6:  Additionally, the grid can be reflected (flipped) over a horizontal or vertical axis, effectively doubling the number of equivalent arrangements.\nStep 7\nStep 8:  The total number of distinct arrangements is given by $\\frac{6!}{8}$.\nStep 9: $\\frac{6!}{8} = \\frac{720}{8} = 90$\nStep 10: $\\frac{720}{8} = 90$\nCalculate $\\frac{6!}{8}$\n$\\frac{720}{8}$\nCalculate $\\frac{720}{8}$\n$\\frac{720}{8} = 90$\n$\\frac{720}{8}$",
