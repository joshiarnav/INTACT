However, the two pairs of balls are interchangeable, so we must divide by 2 to get $6 / 2 = 3$ arrangements.\n\n(2,1,1): There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ options for picking the two balls to go in one box, and each of the other two balls goes into its own box.\n\nThe total number of arrangements is $1 + 4 + 3 + 6 = \\boxed{14}$.",
