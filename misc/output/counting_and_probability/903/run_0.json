    "solution": "The only one-digit integer divisible by $4$ that we can construct is $4$.\n\nWe can construct $3$ two-digit integers divisible by $4$: $12$, $32$, and $24$.\n\nAn integer is divisible by $4$ if its rightmost two digits are divisible by $4$.  Thus we can append either or both of the remaining two digits to any of these two-digit integers and preserve divisibility by $4$.  For each, there are $2$ ways to choose one digit to append, and $2$ ways to order the digits if we append both of them.  Thus we get $4$ more integers for each, or $12$ total.\n\nThe full number is $12+3+1=\\boxed{16}$ integers.",
