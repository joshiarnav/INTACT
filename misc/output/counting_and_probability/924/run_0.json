    "solution": "We have 7 places to plant trees in our row.  We can choose two of these to be Golden Delicious in $\\binom{7}{2}= \\boxed{21}$ ways.  For each of these choices, we plant the Bartlett pears in the remaining 5 places.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Calculate the total number of trees that will be planted.\nTotal number of trees = 2 (Golden Delicious apple trees) + 5 (Bartlett pear trees) = 7\nStep 2: Use the combination formula to determine the number of ways to choose the positions for the 2 identical Golden Delicious apple trees out of the 7 total positions, which is C(7, 2).\nStep 3: Multiply the number of ways to choose the positions for the 2 identical Golden Delicious apple trees by the number of ways to choose the positions for the 5 identical Bartlett pear trees, which is C(7-2, 5) = C(5, 5).\nStep 4: Multiply the results from steps 2 and 3 to find the total number of distinct arrangements.\nStep 4: Multiply the results from steps 2 and 3 to find the total number of distinct arrangements.",
