    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "This is the probability of flipping no heads (three tails) or one head (two tails). This is the same as the probability of flipping two heads (one tail) or three heads (no tails), since we can just interchange heads and tails. Since all outcomes are covered, both probabilities add up to 1, so the desired probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

The favorable outcomes that produce fewer than two heads are HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, and TTH, which consists of six outcomes.\nStep 3: Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.\nStep 4: Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 6/8 = 3/4\nStep 4: Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 6/8 = 3/4",
