    "solution": "There are $20$ potential members that could be president. Once the president is chosen, there are $19$ that could be vice-president. Finally, once those two offices are filled, there are $18$ that could be treasurer. Thus, there are $20 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 18 = \\boxed{6840}$ ways in which the math club can select the officers.",
