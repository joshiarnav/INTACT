The length of the height is equal to the side length of the octagon, which is 2.  To find the length of base $RH$, we notice that $RH=EH-ER$.  Because of the parallel lines, $ERGF$ is a parallelogram, and thus $ER=FG=2$.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2+sqrt(2),sqrt(2))--(2,sqrt(2))--(0,sqrt(2))--(-sqrt(2),sqrt(2))--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,sqrt(2)),dashed); draw((2,0)--(2,sqrt(2)),dashed);\nlabel(\"$F$\",(0,0) ,SW ); label(\"$G$\", (2,0), SE); label(\"$H$\",(2+sqrt(2),sqrt(2)) ,NE ); label(\"$N$\",(2,sqrt(2)) ,N ); label(\"$M$\", (0,sqrt(2)),N ); label(\"$E$\",(-sqrt(2),sqrt(2)) ,NW );\n\n[/asy]\n\nTo find $EH$, we drop two perpendiculars from $F$ and $G$ to $EH$, creating two isosceles right triangles $\\triangle EMF$ and $\\triangle HNG$, and one rectangle $MNGF$.  Since we have $EF=FG=GH=2$, we have $MN=2$ as well.  Also, we have $EM=NH=2/\\sqrt{2}=\\sqrt{2}$.  Thus, $EH=\\sqrt{2}+2+\\sqrt{2}=2+2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFinally, we have $RH=EH-ER = 2+2\\sqrt{2}-2=2\\sqrt{2}$.  The area of parallelogram $DQRH$ is thus $(2\\sqrt{2})(2) = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}}$.",
