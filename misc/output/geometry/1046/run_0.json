    "problem": "Two sides of scalene $\\bigtriangleup ABC$ measure $3$ centimeters and $5$ centimeters. How many different whole centimeter lengths are possible for the third side?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Using the Triangle Inequality, we see that the third side of a triangle with sides $3\\text{ cm}$ and $5\\text{ cm}$ must be larger than $2\\text{ cm}$ but smaller than $8\\text{ cm}.$ If the third side must be a whole centimeter length, and the triangle is scalene, that means that the only possible lengths for the third side are: $4\\text{ cm},$ $6\\text{ cm},$ and $7\\text{ cm}.$ That makes $\\boxed{3}$ possible lengths for the third side.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: According to the triangle inequality, the third side must be greater than the difference and less than the sum of the first two sides.\nStep 2: The third side must be greater than $5-3=2$ and less than $3+5=8$.\nStep 3: Since the third side must be greater than 2 and less than 8, all whole centimeter lengths between 3 and 7 inclusive are possible for the third side, so there are 5 possibilities.\nStep 4: There are no other restrictions on the sides of a triangle, so the 5 different whole centimeter lengths are possible for the third side.\nStep 5: The possible lengths for the third side are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 centimeters.\nStep 6: The possible lengths for the third side are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 centimeters.\nStep 7: The possible lengths for the third side are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 centimeters.\nStep 8: The possible lengths for the third side are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 centimeters.\nStep 9: Final Answer",
