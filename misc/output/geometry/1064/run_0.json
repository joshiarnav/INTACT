    "solution": "The overlap of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 2, so the area of the region covered by the squares is $2(4\\times 4)-(2\\times\n2)=32-4=28$. The diameter of the circle has length $\\sqrt{2^2+2^2}=\\sqrt{8}$, the length of the diagonal of the smaller square. The shaded area created by removing the circle from the squares is $28-\\pi\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{2}\\right)^2=\\boxed{28-2\\pi}$.",

The given square has side length $4$, so its area is simply $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to find the area of the quarter-circle. The diameter of the circle is the segment between the two points of intersection, which is equal to the side length of the square, $4$. This means the radius of the circle is half of the side length, $2$.\nStep 5:  The area of a quarter-circle is $\\frac{1}{4}r^2 \\pi$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Substituting $2$ for $r$, we get $\\frac{1}{4}(2)^2 \\pi = \\pi$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the area of the quarter-circle\nStep 2:  To find the area of the shaded region in one of the squares, we subtract the area of the quarter-circle from the area of the square. It is given that the area of the square is $16$ and the area of the quarter-circle is $\\pi$. Therefore, the area of the shaded region in one of the squares is $16 - \\pi$.\nStep 3:  To find the total shaded area, we multiply the area of the shaded region in one of the squares by 2. This gives us $2(16 - \\pi) = 32 - 2\\pi$.\nSince the problem has already been solved in the previous steps, the correct step is:\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{32-2\\pi}$.",
