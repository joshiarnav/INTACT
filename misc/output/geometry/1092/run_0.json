    "solution": "Point A is traveling along the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 6 inches. This circumference is $6\\pi$ inches.  Point B is traveling along the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 12 inches. This circumference is $12\\pi$ inches. Both points travel 45 degrees, which is $45 \\div 360 = 1/8$ of the circles' circumferences. The difference is then $(1/8)(12\\pi) - (1/8)(6\\pi) = (1/8)(12\\pi - 6\\pi) = (1/8)(6\\pi) = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}\\pi\\text{ inches}}$.",
