    "problem": "Consider the rectangle with vertices at $(5,4),$ $(5,-4),$ $(-5,4),$ $(-5,-4)$. How many integer coordinates will be strictly inside the rectangular region?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Points with integer coordinates are called lattice points. The length of the rectangle is $5 - (-5) = 10$ units. There will be 9 lattice positions between the two vertical sides of the rectangle. The height of the rectangle is $4 - (-4) = 8$ units. There will be 7 lattice positions between the top and bottom of the rectangle. That's a total of $9 \\times 7 = \\boxed{63}$ lattice points.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1:  The rectangle's sides have lengths $10$ and $8$, extending in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively, from the point $(5,4)$.\nStep 2:  To determine the number of integer coordinates inside the rectangle, we can place the rectangle on the coordinate plane and count the number of integer points within it.\nStep 3:  The integer points that are strictly inside the rectangular region will be those points that lie within the rectangle but not on the edges or vertices.\nStep 4:  The points on the edges of the rectangle can be found by determining the integer coordinates on the lines $x = -5, x = 5, y = -4$, and $y = 4$. The integer points on these lines will not be included in the count.\n\nThere is no final answer yet.",
