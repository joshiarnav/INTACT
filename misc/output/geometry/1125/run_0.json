    "problem": "An aquarium has a rectangular base that measures 100 cm by 40 cm and has a height of 50 cm. The aquarium is filled with water to a depth of 37 cm. A rock with volume $1000 \\text{cm}^3$ is then placed in the aquarium and completely submerged. By how many centimeters does the water level rise?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest 100th.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Using the volume formula $lwh = V$, the volume of water in the aquarium is $100 \\times 40 \\times 37 = 148{,}000\n\\text{ cm}^3$. When the rock is put in, the water and the rock will occupy a box-shaped region with volume $148{,}000 + 1000 = 149{,}000\n\\text{ cm}^3$. The volume of the water and the rock is $100 \\times 40\n\\times h$, where $h$ is the new height of the water. $\\text{The new\nvolume} = 4000h = 149{,}000 \\text{ cm}^3$, so the new height is $$h=\\frac{149000}{4000}=37.25 \\text{ cm}.$$After adding the rock, the water rises $37.25-37=\\boxed{0.25\\text{ cm}}$.\n\n\\[ OR \\]Because the shape of the rock is irrelevant, we may assume that the rock is shaped like a rectangular box with base measuring $100\n\\text{ cm} \\times 40 \\text{ cm}$ and height $h$ cm. Using the volume formula, $100 \\times 40 \\times h =1000$, so $h =\n\\frac{1000}{100\\times 40}=0.25 \\text{ cm}$. When the rock is put into the aquarium, the water level will rise by $\\boxed{0.25\\,\\text{ cm}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the volume of water displaced by the rock\nFirst, we must find the volume of water displaced by the rock when it is submerged. Since the rock has a volume of $1000 \\text{cm}^3$, this is also the volume of water it displaces.\n## Step 2: Calculate the area of the base of the aquarium\nThe base of the aquarium is a rectangle that measures 100 cm by 40 cm. The area of the base is $100\\text{cm}\\times 40\\text{cm}=4000 \\text{cm}^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the volume of water displaced by the rock\nThe volume of water displaced by the rock is equal to the volume of the rock, which is $1000 \\text{cm}^3$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the increase in the water level\nTo find the increase in the water level, we divide the volume of water displaced by the rock by the area of the base of the aquarium. The increase in water level is $\\frac{1000 \\text{cm}^3}{4000 \\text{cm}^2} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$ cm.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.25}$",
