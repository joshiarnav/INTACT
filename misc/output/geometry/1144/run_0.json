    "problem": "A particular right pyramid has a square base, and each edge of the pyramid is four inches long. What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic inches? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The base has area $B=4\\cdot 4=16.$  The length of the segment connecting a vertex of the base to the center of the base equals $\\sqrt{2^2+2^2}=2\\sqrt{2}.$   This segment and the altitude of the pyramid form a right triangle with hypotenuse of length $4$.  Thus we have $h=\\sqrt{4^2-(2\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{8}$.  By the volume formula for a pyramid, we have $V=Bh/3=16\\sqrt{8}/3\\approx \\boxed{15.08}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: The formula for the volume of a pyramid is V = 1/3 * B * h, where B is the area of the base and h is the height of the pyramid.\nStep 2: The base of the pyramid is a square with edge length 4 inches, so the area of the base is 4^2 = 16 square inches.\nStep 3: The height of the pyramid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem on one of the triangular sides of the pyramid. If we draw a perpendicular line from the apex of the pyramid to the center of the base, it will bisect the base and create a right triangle with hypotenuse 4 inches (the side of the base) and one leg equal to half the diagonal of the base. The diagonal of the square base is sqrt(4^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(32), so half the diagonal is sqrt(32)/2 = sqrt(8). Using the Pythagorean theorem, the height h of the pyramid is sqrt(4^2 - (sqrt(8)/2)^2) = sqrt(16 - 2) = sqrt(14).\nStep 4: V = 1/3 * 16 * sqrt(14) = 16/3 * sqrt(14) \u2248 16/3 * 3.74 \u2248 19.73\nStep 4: V \u2248 16/3 * 3.74 \u2248 19.73\nStep 5: Rounding to the nearest hundredth, V \u2248 19.73.\nStep 5: Rounding to the nearest hundredth, V \u2248 19.73.",
