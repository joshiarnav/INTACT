    "solution": "Because $\\triangle ABC$, $\\triangle NBK$, and $\\triangle AMJ$ are similar right triangles whose hypotenuses are in the ratio $13:8:1$, their areas are in the ratio $169:64:1$.\n\nThe area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(12)(5)= 30$, so the areas of $\\triangle NBK$ and $\\triangle AMJ$  are  $\\frac{64}{169}(30)$ and $\\frac {1}{169}(30)$, respectively.\n\nThus the area of pentagon $CMJKN$ is $(1-\\frac{64}{169}-\\frac{1}{169})(30) = \\boxed{\\frac{240}{13}}$.",
