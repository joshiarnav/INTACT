    "solution": "By looking at the diagram provided, we can see that the line containing the point of rotation lands on top of itself, but the arrow is facing the opposite direction. This tells us that 1/2 of a full $360^{\\circ}$ rotation was completed; therefore, the image rotated $360^{\\circ}/2 = \\boxed{180^{\\circ}}$ about point $C$.",

We are required to find the angle of rotation in degrees about point $C$ that maps the darker figure to the lighter image.\nStep 2:  An initial step in solving this problem is to identify the symmetries present in the given figure and its image. The given figure has a combination of rotational symmetry and line symmetry.\nStep 3:  Looking at the given figure, we can observe that it has rotational symmetry of order $4$ when point $C$ is the center of rotation. This means that the figure looks the same after a rotation of $90$ degrees about point $C$.\nStep 4:  Additionally, we can see that the given figure also has line symmetry, meaning it remains unchanged when reflected over a line passing through point $C$.\nStep 5:  Based on these observations, we can conclude that the given figure has a total of $8$ symmetries: the $4$ rotations combined with the $4$ reflections.\nStep 6:  We also note that the image of the figure is the result of a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation about point $C\nStep 2:  To determine the angle of rotation, we can examine the symmetry of the image. Both the given figure and its image have rotational symmetry of order $4$ about point $C$. This indicates that the image is the result of a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation about point $C$, but it's unclear if this is the only rotation that maps the darker figure to the lighter image.\nStep 3:  Considering both the given figure and its image have rotational symmetry of order 4 about point C, and that a 90^{\\circ} rotation does map the darker figure to the lighter image, identify other rotations that also satisfy this condition.\nStep 4:  Since we know that a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation maps the darker figure to the lighter image, we can find other angles that satisfy this condition by considering the rotational symmetry of order $4$.\nStep 5:  By considering the rotational symmetry of order 4, we can find other angles that satisfy the condition by adding multiples of 90 degrees to the initial 90 degrees rotation.\nStep 6:  By examining the rotational symmetry of order $4$, we can find other angles by adding multiples of $90^{\\circ}$ to the initial $90^{\\circ}$ rotation. The possible angles are $90^{\\circ}$, $180^{\\circ}$, $270^{\\circ}$, and $360^{\\circ}$.\nThe next step is:\nStep 7:  Given that both the given figure and its image have rotational symmetry of order $4$ about point $C$, any multiple of $90^{\\circ}$ will also map the darker figure to the lighter image. Therefore, the angle of rotation that satisfies this condition is the first angle in the list that we generated, which is $90^{\\circ}$\nStep 8:  Since any multiple of $90^{\\circ}$ will also map the darker figure to the lighter image, the angle of rotation that satisfies this condition is the first angle in the list that we generated, which is $90^{\\circ}$\nStep 9:  The angle of rotation in degrees about point $C$ that maps the darker figure to the lighter image is $\\boxed{90}$.\nStep 10:  The angle of rotation in degrees about point $C$ that maps the darker figure to the lighter image is $\\boxed{90}$.",
