    "solution": "There are two bases on the prism, each with six edges, for a total of 12 base edges. Each vertex on a base is connected to a corresponding vertex on the other base, and since each base has six vertices, there are 6 vertical edges. In total, there are $12+6=\\boxed{18}$ edges.",

    "model_solution": "A hexagon has 6 vertices and 6 edges.\nA prism has two identical polygonal faces and a number of rectangular faces equal to the number of sides of the polygon. The hexagonal faces each have 6 edges and the rectangular faces each have 6 edges, corresponding to the 6 vertices of the hexagon. Each of the 6 rectangular faces has 4 edges, and each of the 6 edges of the hexagon is shared by two rectangular faces. Therefore, the total number of edges is the number of edges of the two hexagonal faces plus 4 times the number of rectangular faces.\nThe number of edges of the two hexagonal faces is 6 + 6 = 12, and the total number of rectangular faces is 6.\nMultiply the total number of rectangular faces by 4 to find the number of rectangular edges.\nMultiply the total number of rectangular faces by 4 to find the number of rectangular edges: 6 \u00d7 4 = 24\nAdd the number of edges of the hexagonal faces and the number of rectangular edges to find the total number of edges: 12 + 24 = 36\nAdd the number of edges of the hexagonal faces and the number of rectangular edges to find the total number of edges: 12 + 24 = 36",
