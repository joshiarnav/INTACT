Thus the parallelogram is composed of two triangles, each of which has area \\[\n9=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot |c-d| \\cdot \\left|\\frac{c-d}{b-a}\\right|.\n\\]It follows that $(c-d)^2=18|b-a|$.\n\nBy a similar argument using the second parallelogram, $(c+d)^2=72|b-a|$. Subtracting the first equation from the second yields $4cd=54|b-a|$, so $2cd = 27|b-a|$. Thus $|b-a|$ is even, and $a+b$ is minimized when $\\{a,b\\}=\\{1,3\\}$. Also, $cd$ is a multiple of 27, and $c+d$ is minimized when $\\{c,d\\}=\\{3,9\\}$. Hence the smallest possible value of $a+b+c+d$ is $1+3+3+9=\\boxed{16}$. Note that the required conditions are satisfied when $(a,b,c,d)=(1,3,3,9)$.",
