    "problem": "Mrs. Read can knit one pair of children's mittens with a ball of yarn six inches in diameter. How many pairs of identical mittens can she knit with a ball of yarn twelve inches in diameter? Assume that the balls of yarn are rolled consistently.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "A ball of yarn 12 inches in diameter has twice the diameter of a ball of yarn 6 inches in diameter.  Let the radius of the small ball be $r$ and the radius of the large ball be $2r$.  Then, the volume of the small ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the volume of the large ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2r)^3 = 8\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Hence the large ball has 8 times the volume of the small ball, so Mrs. Read can knit $\\boxed{8}$ pairs of identical mittens with the large yarn ball.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the relationship between the diameter of the yarn balls and the number of mittens she can knit with each.\nStep 2: Recognize that the volume of the yarn balls is proportional to the number of mittens Mrs. Read can knit with each, since a larger ball of yarn will allow her to knit more pairs of mittens.\nStep 3: Calculate the ratio of the volumes of the two balls of yarn.\nStep 4: Since the two balls of yarn are spheres, use the formula for the volume of a sphere (V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3) to calculate the volumes of the two balls of yarn, where r is the radius.\nStep 5: Use the ratio of the volumes to find the number of pairs of mittens Mrs. Read can knit with the 12-inch ball of yarn.\nStep 4: Calculate the volumes of the two balls of yarn. \nThe volume of the 6-inch ball is V1 = (4/3)\u03c0(3)\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(27) and the volume of the 12-inch ball is V2 = (4/3)\u03c0(6)\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(216).\nStep 5: Use the ratio of the volumes to find the number of pairs of mittens Mrs. Read can knit with the 12-inch ball of yarn.",
