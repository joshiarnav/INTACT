So, the side length of the base is 3.  Since the pyramid is a right regular pyramid, each edge from the apex to a vertex of the base has the same length.  So, the sum of the lengths of the edges from the apex to the vertices on the base is $6\\cdot 6 = 36$.  Adding the perimeter of the base gives us the sum of all the edge lengths, which is $36 + 6\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{54}$.",
