Therefore, triangles $WYX$ and $WYZ$ are right triangles.\n\nFrom right triangle $WYZ$, we have $\\tan Z = \\frac{WY}{ZY}$, so $WY = ZY\\cdot \\tan Z = 12\\cdot 1.5 = 18$.  From right triangle $WXY$, we have $\\tan X = \\frac{WY}{WX}$, so \\[WX = \\frac{WY}{\\tan X} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6.\\]Therefore, the area of $WXYZ$ is \\[\\frac{WX+YZ}{2}\\cdot WY = 9\\cdot 18 = \\boxed{162}.\\]",
