    "problem": "One cube has a volume of 343 cubic centimeters. The edge length of a second cube is three times the edge length of this first cube. What is the positive difference between the volume of the second cube and the volume of the first cube, in cubic centimeters?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "By homothety, the second cube has a volume that is $3^3 = 27$ times that of the first.  Hence the difference in the cubes' volumes is $27\\cdot 343 - 343 = \\boxed{8918}$ cubic centimeters.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Find the edge length of the first cube.\nThe edge length of the first cube is the cube root of its volume, so edge length = \u221b343 = 7 cm.\nStep 2: Find the volume of the second cube.\nThe volume of the second cube is the cube of its edge length, so volume = (3*7)^3 = 1029 cubic centimeters.\nStep 3: Find the positive difference between the volume of the second cube and the volume of the first cube.\nPositive difference = volume of second cube - volume of first cube = 1029 - 343 cubic centimeters = 686 cubic centimeters.
