    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If the side lengths are 8, 15, and 17, then we have a right triangle on our hands. That means the area is simply $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 15 = 60.$ Now, we find the semi-perimeter $s = \\frac{8 + 15 + 17}{2} = 20.$\n\nPlugging into $A = rs$ and solving for inradius $r,$ we have $60 = 20r,$ so $r = 3.$ However, the problem asks for diameter, so our answer is $\\boxed{6}.$",

The semiperimeter (s) is (8 + 15 + 17)/2.\nStep 3: Calculate the semiperimeter (s) = (8 + 15 + 17)/2 = 20, then use Heron's formula to find the area (A) of the triangle: A = \u221a(20(20-8)(20-15)(20-17)) = \u221a(20 * 12 * 5 * 3) = \u221a3600 = 60.\nStep 4: Use the formula for the inradius (r = A/s) to find the inradius: r = 60/20 = 3.\nStep 5: Find the diameter of the incircle, which is twice the inradius (d = 2r), so d = 2(3) = 6.\nStep 6: Final Answer: The diameter of the incircle is 6.",
