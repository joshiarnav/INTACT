    "solution": "Since $D, E, $ and $F$ are all midpoints, the triangles formed are congruent (see picture): $\\overline{DF} \\cong \\overline{AE} \\cong \\overline{EB}$, because the line connecting two midpoints in a triangle is equal, in length, to half of the base. Similarly,  $\\overline{DE} \\cong \\overline{CF} \\cong \\overline{FB}$ and $\\overline{EF} \\cong \\overline{AD} \\cong \\overline{DC}$. From these congruencies, shown in the pictures below, $\\triangle CDF \\cong \\triangle DAE \\cong \\triangle FEB \\cong \\triangle EFD$, by SSS, and therefore must all have the same area.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\nimport olympiad;\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = (0,0); B = (15, 0); C = (0, 24);\nE = midpoint(A--B); D = midpoint(A--C); F = midpoint(B--C);\ndraw(A--B); draw(B--C); draw(C--A);\ndraw(D--F); draw(F--E); draw(E--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, S);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, S);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, W);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, S);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NE);\ndraw(rightanglemark(C, A, B, 20));\nadd(pathticks(A--D,2,0.5,10,25)); add(pathticks(D--C,2,0.5,10,25)); add(pathticks(E--F,2,0.5,10,25));\n\nadd(pathticks(A--E,1,0.5,0,25)); add(pathticks(E--B,1,0.5,0,25)); add(pathticks(D--F,1,0.5,0,25));\n\nadd(pathticks(C--F,3,0.5,10,25)); add(pathticks(F--B,3,0.5,10,25)); add(pathticks(D--E,3,0.5,10,25));\n\n[/asy]\n\nFurthermore, we know that $AB = 15 \\text{ units}$, $AC = 24 \\text{ units}$, so since $D$ and $E$ are midpoints, $\\rightarrow AD = \\frac{15}{2} \\text{ units}$, and $AE = \\frac{24}{2} \\text{ units}$.
