    "solution": "We know that each of the unit cubes in the $3\\times3\\times3$ cube in the center of the $5\\times5\\times5$ cube has no paint on it. On the surface of the cube, three of the unit cubes on each edge of the big cube have no paint on them, and the center unit cube of each face of the big cube has no paint on it. Since a cube has $12$ edges and $6$ faces, this makes a total of $3\\cdot3\\cdot3 + 12\\cdot3 + 6\\cdot1 = 69$ unit cubes with no paint on them. There are $125$ unit cubes altogether. The fraction with no paint is $\\boxed{\\frac{69}{125}}.$",
