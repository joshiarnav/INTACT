    "solution": "If the triangle is rotated about the shorter leg, then the radius is the longer leg and the height is the shorter leg, and the volume is  \\[\\frac13\\cdot (15^2\\pi)(8) = 600\\pi\\text{ cubic centimeters}.\\] If the triangle is rotated about the longer leg, then the radius is the shorter leg and the height is the longer leg, and the volume is $\\frac13(8^2\\pi)(15)$, which is $\\frac{8}{15}$ of the volume we found earlier.  So, the maximum possible volume is $\\boxed{600\\pi}$ cubic centimeters.",
