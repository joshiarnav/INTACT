    "problem": "Alana is making a ball out of rubber bands.  When the ball has 54 rubber bands, it has a diameter of 3 cm.  How many rubber bands should Alana add to the ball to increase its diameter by 1 cm?  Assume that all of Alana's rubber bands have the same volume.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since the volume of a sphere is directly proportional to its diameter cubed, the ratio of the volume of the ball with a diameter of 4 cm to the volume of the ball with a diameter of 3 cm is $(4/3)^3\n= 64/27$.  Since all of the rubber bands have the same volume, it follows that the number of rubber bands in the ball with diameter 4 is \\[ (4/3)^3 \\cdot 54 = \\frac{64}{27} \\cdot 54 = 64 \\cdot 2 = 128. \\]Therefore the number of rubber bands that Alana needs to add to the ball is $128 - 54 = \\boxed{74}$.",
