    "problem": "Two sides of an isosceles triangle are 15 cm and 10 cm. What is the greatest possible perimeter of this triangle, in centimeters?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The third side must be equal in length to one of the first two sides. To maximize the perimeter, we set the third side equal to 15 cm. The perimeter is then $15+15+10=\\boxed{40}$ centimeters.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Identify the type of triangle and determine the possible arrangement of the sides given for the triangle (isosceles or scalene).\nStep 2: Determine that the 15 cm sides must be the equal sides because it is an isosceles triangle.\nStep 3: The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of all sides. Since it is an isosceles triangle, two sides are 15 cm each, and one side is 10 cm. The greatest possible perimeter will be when the base (10 cm side) is opposite the largest angle, which is between the two equal sides.\nStep 4: Calculate the greatest possible perimeter by adding the lengths of all sides: 15 cm + 15 cm + 10 cm.\nStep 5: The calculation for the greatest possible perimeter is 15 cm + 15 cm + 10 cm = 40 cm.\nStep 6: The final answer is: $\\boxed{40}$",
