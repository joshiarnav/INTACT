    "problem": "What is the radius, in inches, of a right circular cylinder if its lateral surface area is $3.5$ square inches and its volume is $3.5$ cubic inches?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the radius be $r$ and the height be $h$. Since the lateral surface area is 3.5 square inches, we have $2\\pi rh=3.5$. Since the volume is 3.5 cubic inches, we have $\\pi r^2h=3.5$. Dividing the latter equation by the former, we find that $r=\\boxed{2}$ inches.",
