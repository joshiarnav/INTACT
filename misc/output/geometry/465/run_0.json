    "solution": "Suppose that $\\angle ADC = x^\\circ$. The area of the unshaded portion of the inner circle is thus $\\frac x{360}$ of the total area of the inner circle, or $\\frac x{360}(\\pi(1^2)) = \\frac x{360} \\pi$ (since $\\angle ADC$ is $\\frac x{360}$ of the largest possible central angle ($360^\\circ$)).\n\nThe area of shaded portion of the inner circle is thus $$\\pi - \\frac x{360}\\pi = \\frac{360 - x}{360}\\pi.$$ The total area of the outer ring is the difference of the areas of the outer and inner circles, or $\\pi(2^2) - \\pi(1^2) = 3\\pi$. The shaded region of the outer ring will be $\\frac x{360}$ of this total area. So the shaded region of the outer ring is $\\frac x{360} (3\\pi) = \\frac{3x}{360}\\pi$.\n\nSo the total shaded area (which must equal $\\frac53 \\pi$) is, in terms of $x$, $$\\frac{3x}{360} \\pi + \\frac{360 - x}{360} \\pi = \\frac{360 + 2x}{360} \\pi.$$ Therefore, $$\\frac{360 + 2x}{360} = \\frac53 = \\frac{600}{360},$$ so $360 + 2x = 600$, or $x = \\boxed{120}$.",
