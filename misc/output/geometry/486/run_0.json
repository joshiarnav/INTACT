    "problem": "A company sells peanut butter in cylindrical jars. Marketing research suggests that using wider jars will increase sales. If the diameter of the jars is increased by $25\\%$ without altering the volume, by what percent must the height be decreased?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let $r, h,$ and $V$, respectively, be the radius, height, and volume of the jar that is currently being used. The new jar will have a radius of $1.25r$ and volume $V$. Let $H$ be the height of the new jar. Then \\[\n\\pi r^{2} h = V = \\pi (1.25r)^{2} H,\\] so \\[\n\\frac{H}{h}=\\frac{1}{(1.25)^{2}}= 0.64.\n\\] Thus $H$ is $64\\%$ of $h$, so the height must be reduced by $(100 - 64)\\% = \\boxed{36} \\%$.",
