    "solution": "Since the ratio $AN:AC$ equals the ratio $AP:AB$ (each is $1:2$) and $\\angle A$ is common in $\\triangle APN$ and $\\triangle ABC$, then $\\triangle APN$ is similar to $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nSince the ratio of side lengths between these two triangles is $1:2$, then the ratio of areas is $1:2^2=1:4$.\n\nThus, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $4 \\times 2 = \\boxed{8}\\mbox{ cm}^2$.",
