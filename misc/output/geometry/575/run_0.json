    "problem": "The surface area of a particular cube is 600 square inches. When the edges of the cube are doubled in length, what is the volume of the new cube, in cubic inches?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let $s$ be the original side length, in inches. We originally have $6s^2 = 600,$ so $s=10.$ Doubling $s,$ the volume becomes $20^3=\\boxed{8000}$ cubic inches.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: The original cube has a surface area of 600 square inches.\nStep 2: Let s be the length of each edge of the original cube. The surface area of the cube is 6s^2 = 600.\nStep 3: Solve the equation 6s^2 = 600 for s to get s^2 = 100, so s = 10.\nStep 4: When the edges are doubled in length, the new side length is 2s = 2(10) = 20.\nStep 5: The volume of the new cube is s^3, where s = 20, so the volume is 20^3 = 8000.\nStep 6: The volume of the new cube is s^3, where s = 20, so the volume is 20^3 = 8000.
