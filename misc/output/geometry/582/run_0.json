We see the radius of the cylinder is $r$ and the height of the cylinder is $2r$.  Thus, from the cylinder's volume we have \\[60 = \\pi (r^2)(2r) = 2\\pi r^3.\\]  Dividing both sides by 2 yields $\\pi r^3 = 30$.  The volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}(30) = \\boxed{40}\\] cubic centimeters.  (Notice that we didn't have to solve for $r$!)",
