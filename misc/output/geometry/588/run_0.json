    "problem": "A cube of side 3 inches has a cube of side 1 inch cut from each corner. A cube of side 2 inches is then inserted in each corner. What is the number of square inches in the surface area of the resulting solid?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Our initial cube has 6 faces with 9 square inches of surface area each for a total of 54 square inches. When we cut away the 8 cubes of side length one, we remove 3 square inches of surface area for each one for a total of 24 square inches of surface area lost. We then add a 2 inch cube to each corner for a total of 8 more cubes. A 2 inch cube has a surface area of 24 but each of these cubes is missing 3 $\\text{in}^2$ of surface area, so the total surface area is $54-24+8(24-3)=\\boxed{198}$ square inches.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Calculate the original surface area of the large cube (6 faces, each 3 inches by 3 inches).\nStep 2: Calculate the surface area of the large cube that is removed when the small cubes are cut out (8 faces, each 1 inch by 1 inch, and 12 faces, each 3 inches by 1 inch, and 8 faces, each 3 inches by 3 inches).\nStep 3: Calculate the surface area of the large cube that is covered when the small cubes are inserted (8 faces, each 2 inches by 2 inches).\nStep 4: The surface area of the resulting solid is the original surface area of the large cube minus the surface area covered by the small cubes plus the surface area of the small cubes that were added, which is 6 * 3^2 - 8 * 2^2 + 8 * 2^2 + 8 * (3^2 - 2^2) + 12 * 2^2 + 8 * 3^2.\nStep 5: Simplify and evaluate the expression to find the total surface area: 6 * 9 - 8 * 4 + 8 * 4 + 8 * 5 + 12 * 4 + 8 * 9 = 54 - 32 + 32 + 40 + 48 + 72 = 214.\nStep 5: 54 - 32 + 32 + 40 + 48 + 72 = 214\n54 - 32 + 32 + 40 + 48 + 72 = 214\nThe final answer is: 214",
