    "problem": "If the angles of a trapezoid form an arithmetic sequence and the smallest angle measures $60^{\\circ}$, what is the measure of the largest angle, in degrees?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the common difference of this arithmetic sequence be $d$. The four angles of the trapezoid are $60$, $60+d$, $60+2d$, and $60+3d$. Since the interior angles in a trapezoid add up to equal 360 degrees, we have the equation $60+(60+d)+(60+2d)+(60+3d)=360\\Rightarrow d=20$. Thus, the largest angle in the trapezoid is $60+3\\cdot20=\\boxed{120}$ degrees.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Let $a$ be the common difference between the angles in the arithmetic sequence.\nSince the smallest angle measures $60^{\\circ}$, we can express the other three angles in the trapezoid as $60^{\\circ} + a$, $60^{\\circ} + 2a$, and $60^{\\circ} + 3a$.\nStep 2:  Since the sum of the interior angles of a trapezoid is $360^{\\circ}$, we can write the equation $60^{\\circ} + (60^{\\circ} + a) + (60^{\\circ} + 2a) + (60^{\\circ} + 3a) = 360^{\\circ}$.\n\nFinal Answer:",
