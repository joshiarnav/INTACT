    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The two bases are octagons, each with 8 sides, so the bases have a total of $8\\times2=16$ edges. Then there are edges connecting the two bases. With one edge for each vertex of a base, we have 8 edges connecting the bases. So the total number of edges is $16+8=\\boxed{24}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Identify the shape of the prism as an octagon and a prism, which means it has a polygon base and a set of rectangular faces that connect the polygon base to a parallel polygon base.\nStep 2: An octagonal prism has 8 sides on its base. Adding an 8-sided base to a rectangular prism that has 2 bases, it has 8 rectangular faces, each edge of the base is connected to the corresponding edge on the other base, which adds 8 edges.\nStep 3: Count the 8 edges of each of the 8 rectangular faces of the prism.\nStep 4: 8 rectangular faces have 4 edges each, with each edge being shared by two faces.\nStep 5: Multiply the number of rectangular faces (8) by the number of edges per face (4), then subtract the number of shared edges (8 * 4 - 8)\nStep 6: 32 - 8 = 24\nStep 7: The octagonal prism also has 8 vertices, and each edge connects 2 vertices, so the total number of edges is equal to the sum of the edges from the rectangular faces and the edges from the vertices, which is 24 + 8, but the edges from the vertices are already counted in the edges from the rectangular faces, so we just have 24.\nStep 7: The total number of edges is 24.\nThe octagonal prism has 8 vertices, and each edge connects 2 vertices, so the total number of edges is equal to the sum of the edges from the rectangular faces and the edges from the vertices.\nStep 7: The octagonal prism also has 8 vertices, and each edge connects 2 vertices, so the total number of edges is equal to the sum of the edges from the rectangular faces and the edges from the vertices, which is 24 + 8, but the edges from the vertices are already counted in the edges from the rectangular faces, so we just have 24.",
