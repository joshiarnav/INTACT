Since we have an isosceles triangle on our hands, let's drop a median/altitude/bisector from $B$ as well: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE;\npA = (-2, 0);\npB = (0, 4.5826);\npC = (2, 0);\npD = (pB * 4 + pC * 5) / (9);\npE = (0, 0);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pA--pD);\ndraw(pB--pE);\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, N);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", pD, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", pE, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(pB,pE,pA,7));\n[/asy] We might be able to create some usable right triangles if we draw a perpendicular segment from $D$ to $AC$: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF;\npA = (-2, 0);\npB = (0, 4.5826);\npC = (2, 0);\npD = (pB * 4 + pC * 5) / (9);\npE = (0, 0);\npF = (pE * 4 + pC * 5) / (9);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pA--pD);\ndraw(pB--pE);\ndraw(pD--pF);\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, N);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", pD, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", pE, S);\nlabel(\"$F$\", pF, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(pB,pE,pA,7));\ndraw(rightanglemark(pD,pF,pA,7));\n[/asy] Thanks to $AA$ similarity, we see that $\\triangle DFC \\sim \\triangle BEC.$ We see that $CD:CB = DF:BE = CF:CE.$ As for $CD:CB,$ we know that $CD:DB = 4:5$ by the Angle Bisector Theorem. Since $CB = CD + DB,$ it follows that $CD:CB = DF:BE = CF:CE = 4:9.$ That means $DF = BE \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right),$ and $CF = CE \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right).$\n\nSince $CE$ is half of $AC,$ we have that $CE = 2$ and $CF = \\frac{8}{9}.$ Then, $AF = AC - FC = 4 - \\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{28}{9}.$\n\nWe apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find that $AD^2 = DF^2 + AF^2.$ We just found $AF,$ and as for $DF,$ we have $DF = BE \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right).$ Squaring both sides, we have $DF^2 = BE^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{16}{81}\\right).$ We know that $BE^2 = BC^2 - CE^2 = 5^2 - 2^2 = 21.$ Therefore, $DF^2 = 21 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{16}{81}\\right).$\n\nGoing back to the expression for $AD^2,$ we now have \\begin{align*}\nAD^2 &= DF^2 + AF^2 \\\\\n&= 21 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{16}{81}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{28}{9}\\right)^2\\\\\n&= \\frac{336}{81} + \\frac{784}{81} = \\boxed{\\frac{1120}{81}}.\n\\end{align*}",
