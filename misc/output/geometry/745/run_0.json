    "problem": "A triangle can be formed having side lengths $4,$ $5,$ and $8.$ It is impossible, however, to construct a triangle with side lengths $4,$ $5,$ and $10.$ Using the side lengths $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ $7,$ and $11,$ how many different triangles with exactly two equal sides can be formed?",

    "solution": "The sum of any two sides of a triangle must be bigger than the third side.\n\n(When two sides are known to be equal, we only need to check if the sum of the two equal sides is longer than the third side, since the sum of one of the equal sides and the third side will always be longer than the other equal side.)\n\nIf the equal sides were both equal to $2,$ the third side must be shorter than $2+2=4.$ The $1$ possibility from the list not equal to $2$ (since we cannot have three equal sides) is $3.$ So here there is $1$ possibility.\n\nIf the equal sides were both equal to $3,$ the third side must be shorter than $3+3=6.$ The $2$ possibilities from the list not equal to $3$ (since we cannot have three equal sides) are $2$ and $5.$ So here there are $2$ possibilities.\n\nIf the equal sides were both equal to $5,$ the third side must be shorter than $5+5=10.$ The $3$ possibilities from the list not equal to $5$ (since we cannot have three equal sides) are $2,$ $3$ and $7.$ So here there are $3$ possibilities.\n\nIf the equal sides were both equal to $7,$ the third side must be shorter than $7+7=14.$ The $4$ possibilities from the list not equal to $7$ (since we cannot have three equal sides) are $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $11.$ So here there are $4$ possibilities.\n\nIf the equal sides were both equal to $11,$ the third side must be shorter than $11+11=22.$ The $4$ possibilities from the list not equal to $11$ (since we cannot have three equal sides) are $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ So here there are $4$ possibilities.\n\nThus, in total there are $1+2+3+4+4=\\boxed{14}$ possibilities.",
