    "solution": "Let us draw our triangle and altitudes and label our points of interest: [asy]\npair A, B, C, D, E, F;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-6, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nD = (0, 0);\nE = foot(B,A,C);\nF = foot(C,A,B);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\ndraw(rightanglemark(B,E,C,10));\ndraw(rightanglemark(C,F,B,10));\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,D,C,10));\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\n[/asy] We have made $AB = AC = 10$ and $BC = 12.$ We can notice a few useful things. Since $ABC$ is isosceles, it follows that $AD$ is a median as well as an altitude, which is useful since that means $BD = DC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BC = 6.$ Now, since $DC = 6$ and $AC = 10,$ we have a $3:4:5$ Pythagorean triple and $AD = 8$. Now we can find the area of $ABC$ by finding $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AD \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 12 = 48.$\n\nNow, we can find $BE$ by using the area we just found: $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC \\cdot BE = 48.$ Since $AC = 10,$ that means $BE = 9.6$ By symmetry, $CF$ is also $9.6.$ Our answer is: $9.6 + 9.6 + 8 = \\boxed{27.2}.$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the type of triangle with side lengths 10, 10, and 12.\nThis is an isosceles triangle with two equal sides, 10.\nStep 2: Draw an altitude from the vertex with the equal sides to the base (side with length 12). This creates two right triangles with legs of length 6 and 8, and hypotenuse of length 10.\nStep 3: The altitude drawn in step 2 is also an altitude of the original triangle. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the altitude of the original triangle.\nStep 4: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the altitude of the original triangle: $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$, where $a$ is the length of the altitude, $b$ is the length of the leg of the right triangle, and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse. Here, we know that $b=6$ and $c=10$, so $a^{2}+6^{2}=10^{2}$, which implies that $a^{2}=64$, and $a=8$.\nStep 5: By symmetry, the other altitude of the isosceles triangle has the same length as the altitude found in step 4. The third altitude of the isosceles triangle is perpendicular to the base and splits it in half, so its length is equal to the height of the right triangle with the base of length 6.\nStep 6: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the third altitude: $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$, where $a$ is the length of the altitude, $b$ is the length of the leg of the right triangle, and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse. Here, we know that $b=3$ and $c=6$, so $a^{2}+3^{2}=6^{2}$, which implies that $a^{2}=27$ and $a=\\sqrt{27}=3\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 7: Sum the lengths of the three altitudes to find the total length of the altitudes.\nFinal Answer",
