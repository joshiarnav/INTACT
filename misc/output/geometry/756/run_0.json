    "solution": "Triangles $CHB$ and $GFB$ are similar, so we have $\\frac{GF}{FB}=\\frac{CH}{HB}$. Since $HB = HF + FB = 18$, we see that $GF=8$.  Therefore, the total area of triangles $DEA$ and $GFB$ combined is $2\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}(6)(8)=48$ square centimeters.  The area of triangle $ABC$ is \\[\\frac{1}{2}(AB)(CH)=\\frac{1}{2}(36)(24)=432\\] square centimeters.  The area of the pentagon is the difference between these two areas, $432-48=\\boxed{384}$ square centimeters.",
