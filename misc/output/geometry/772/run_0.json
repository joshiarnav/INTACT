    "solution": "Let $O$ be the center of the sphere, and assume for now that $O$ is inside polyhedron $P$. We can carve polyhedron $P$ into pyramids, each of which has a face of $P$ as its base and $O$ as its apex. For example, a cube would be carved into six pyramids, two of which are highlighted in this drawing: [asy]\nsize(4cm);\nimport three;\ntriple A,B,C,D,EE,F,G,H;\nA = (0,0,0);\nB = (1,0,0);\nC = (1,1,0);\nD= (0,1,0);\nEE = (0,0,1);\nF = B+EE;\nG = C + EE;\nH = D + EE;\nO = G/2;\ndraw(surface(B--O--C--cycle),red,nolight);\ndraw(surface(C--O--D--cycle),red+white,nolight);\ndraw(surface(H--O--G--cycle),lightblue,nolight);\ndraw(surface(G--O--F--cycle),blue,nolight);\ndraw(surface(EE--F--G--H--cycle),lightblue+blue,nolight);\ndraw(B--C--D);\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\ndraw(EE--F--G--H--EE);\ndraw(A--EE,dashed);\ndraw(B--F);\ndraw(C--G);\ndraw(D--H);\ndraw(A--O--C,dashed);\ndraw(B--O--D,dashed);\ndraw(EE--O--G,dashed);\ndraw(F--O--H,dashed);\ndot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(EE); dot(F); dot(G); dot(H); dot(O);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,WSW);\n[/asy] Then if we add up the areas of all the pyramids' bases, we get the surface area of $P$. If we add up the volumes of the pyramids, we get the volume of $P$.\n\nThe volume of each pyramid is equal to $\\frac 13\\cdot\\text{(area of base)}\\cdot\\text{(height)}$. The height of each pyramid must be less than $36$, since the height of each pyramid extends from $O$ to a point inside the sphere. Therefore, the volume of each pyramid is less than $12$ times the area of the base. It follows that the volume of $P$ is less than $12$ times the surface area of $P$. We can, however, make this ratio arbitrarily close to $12$ by selecting polyhedra $P$ with many small faces, so that the height of each pyramid is as close as we wish to $36$.\n\nTherefore, for polyhedra inscribed in a sphere of radius $36$ such that the center of the sphere lies inside the polyhedron, the least upper bound on $$\\frac{\\text{volume of }P}{\\text{surface area of }P}$$is $12$. Finally, we must consider the case of inscribed polyhedra for which the center of the sphere does not lie inside the polyhedron. However, in this case, we can still construct pyramids with apex $O$ whose bases are the faces of $P$; then the surface area of $P$ is still the sum of the areas of the bases, but the volume of $P$ is less than the total volume of the pyramids. This only strengthens the argument for an upper bound of $12$. So, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$.",

This also means that the radius of the sphere is equal to the circumradius of the polyhedron.\nStep 4:  We are given that the radius of the sphere is $36$, so we can start with this information.\nStep 5:  To find a relationship between the volume and the surface area of the polyhedron, we can consider the average distance from the center of the sphere to the faces of the polyhedron. Let's denote this distance as $2r$, which is also equal to $2 \\times 36 = 72$.\nStep 6:  The average distance from the center of the sphere to the faces of the polyhedron can also be\nStep 7:  Let $F$ be the number of faces of the polyhedron, $V$ be the number of vertices, and $E$ be the number of edges. The average distance from a vertex of the polyhedron to the face of a particular color is $2r$. Therefore, the average distance from a vertex to its adjacent face is less than or equal to $2r$, implying $2r \\le \\frac{3E}{V}$, which gives us $V \\ge \\frac{3E}{2r}$.\n \nWe'll continue from here, but this step is quite long.\nStep 2:  We now need to establish a lower bound for the surface area of the polyhedron. Using Euler's formula for polyhedra, we have $V - E + F = 2.$ We can rearrange this to get $E = V + F - 2$.\n \nWe'll continue from here.\nStep 3: Let's use the isoperimetric inequality to find a lower bound for the surface area of the polyhedron. This inequality states that for any simple polygon with $n$ sides and area $A$, the perimeter $P$ is greater than or equal to $\\sqrt{4\\pi n}$. Applying this to the polyhedron, we can get a lower bound for its surface area.\nStep 4:  We can use the isoperimetric inequality to get a lower bound for the surface area of the polyhedron. If $A$ is the area of a face of the polyhedron and $P$ is the perimeter of that face, the isoperimetric inequality gives us $P^2 \\ge 4\\pi A$.

We can apply this to the polyhedron to find a lower bound for its volume.\nStep 5: Using Cauchy-Schwarz, we have $$(VF)(AE) \\ge V^2 A^2 \\Rightarrow  VF \\ge \\frac{V^2 A^2}{AE} = \\frac{VA}{E}.$$Since $VA \\le 2E$, we can deduce that $VF \\ge \\frac{2VA}{E}$.\nStep 4:  Using Cauchy-Schwarz, we have $$(VF)(AE) \\ge V^2 A^2 \\Rightarrow  VF \\ge \\frac{V^2 A^2}{AE} = \\frac{VA}{E}.$$Since $VA \\le 2E$, we can deduce that $VF \\ge \\frac{2VA}{E}.$\nStep 5:  Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again, we have $$(VF)(AE) \\ge \\left(\\frac{VF}{2} - 2\\right)^2.$$Since $V \\ge \\frac{3E}{2r}$ and $F \\ge \\frac{2VA}{E}$, we can find a lower bound for the expression $\\frac{VF}{2} - 2$.\nWe now apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to $\\left(\\frac{VF}{2} - 2\\right)^2$ to get\n$\\left(\\frac{VF}{2} - 2\\right)^2 \\ge \\left(\\frac{VF}{6}\\right)^2.$\nWe can now solve for $\\frac{VF}{2} - 2$ and substitute it into our previous inequality.\n\n$\\frac{VF}{2} - 2 \\ge \\frac{VF}{6} \\Rightarrow VF \\ge 24$.\n\nWe can now substitute this value of $VF$ back into our previous inequality to find a lower bound for $\\frac{VA}{E}$.\n\n$\\frac{2VA}{E} \\ge 24 \\Rightarrow \\frac{VA}{E} \\ge 12$.\n\nWe can now use this lower bound for $\\frac{VA}{E}$ to find a lower bound for the volume of the polyhedron.\n\n$V^2A^2 \\ge \\frac{2VA}{E} \\cdot VF \\ge 24 \\cdot 12 = 288$\n\nSince $VA \\le 2E$, we have\n\n$V^2A",
