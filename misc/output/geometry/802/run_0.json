    "problem": "What is the number of square units in the area of a triangle whose sides measure 5, 5 and 6 units?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "This triangle is isosceles, and so the altitude to the side with length 6 must hit that side at its midpoint. Thus our triangle is divided into two right triangles with hypotenuse $5$ and one side of length $3$. Thus each of these is a $3-4-5$ triangle, and each one has area $\\frac{3 \\times 4}{2} = 6$, for a total area of $\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Apply Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle.\nStep 2: Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle is given by the formula A = \u221a(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)), where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, and s is the semi-perimeter, which is given by s = (a + b + c)/2. First, find the semi-perimeter, s = (5 + 5 + 6)/2 = 8.\nStep 2: Plug the semi-perimeter and side lengths into Heron's formula: A = \u221a(8(8 - 5)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)) = \u221a(8(3)(3)(2)) = \u221a(144) = 12.\nStep 3: The area of the triangle is 12 square units.\nStep 4: The area of the triangle is 12 square units.\nStep 3: The area of the triangle is 12 square units.",
