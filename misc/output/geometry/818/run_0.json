    "solution": "Since $\\overline{BC}\\cong\\overline{DC}$, that means $\\angle DBC\\cong\\angle BDC$ and $$m\\angle DBC=m\\angle BDC=70^\\circ.$$ We see that $\\angle BDC$ and $\\angle ADC$ must add up to $180^\\circ$, so $m\\angle ADC=180-70=110^\\circ$. Triangle $ACD$ is an isosceles triangle, so the base angles must be equal. If the base angles each have a measure of $x^\\circ$, then $m\\angle ADC+2x=180^\\circ.$  This gives us  $$110+2x=180,$$ so $2x=70$ and  $x=35.$  Since $\\angle BAC$ is one of the base angles, it has a measure of $\\boxed{35^\\circ}$.",
