    "solution": "The remaining two angles are either 40 degrees and $180-40-40=100$ degrees, or they are both $(180-40)/2=70$ degrees.  The sum of the distinct possible values for angle $P$ is $40+100+70=\\boxed{210}$ degrees.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Since triangle PQR is isosceles, two of its angles have the same measure, and we know that the measure of angle R is 40 degrees. Let's denote the measure of angle P as x and the measure of the other angle as y. Since the sum of the measures of the angles of any triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation: x + 40 + y = 180.\nStep 2: x + y = 140\nStep 3: Since the triangle is isosceles and angle R is 40 degrees, the base angles (P and the other angle) must have equal measures, or one must be greater than the other by 20 degrees. Therefore, x = y, x = y + 20, or y = x + 20.\nStep 4: \nx = y\nx = y + 20\ny = x + 20\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation x + y = 140, we get the following three equations:\nx + x = 140\nx + x + 20 = 140\nx + 20 + x = 140\nTherefore, the equations become:\n2x = 140\n2x = 120\n2x = 160\nStep 5: \n2x = 140 \u2192 x = 70\n2x = 120 \u2192 x = 60\n2x = 160 \u2192 x = 80\nSince the triangle is isosceles and angle R is 40 degrees, the base angles (P and the other angle) must have equal measures, or one must be greater than the other by 20 degrees. Therefore, the other two possible measures of angle P are y = x = 70 and z = x + 20 = 90. However, y cannot be equal to x since the other angle is not equal to x. Similarly, z cannot be equal to x + 20 since the other angle is not equal to x.\nStep 6: \nx = 70, y = 60, z = 80\nFinal Answer",
