    "problem": "How many square units are in the area of the largest square that can be inscribed in a circle with radius 1 unit?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The diagonal of a square inscribed in a circle is a diameter of the circle, so the length of the diagonal of the square is 2 units.  Recall that the area of a square with diagonal $d$ is $d^2/2$.  The area of a square whose diagonal measures 2 units is $2^2/2=\\boxed{2}$ square units.\n\nNote: To derive the area formula $d^2/2$, divide the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles.  The side length of the square is $d/\\sqrt{2}$ and its area $(d/\\sqrt{2})^2=d^2/2$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: The diameter of the circle with radius 1 unit is 2 units. The largest square that can be inscribed in the circle will have its diagonal as the diameter of the circle.\nStep 2: If the diagonal of the square is 2 units, then the side length of the square can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let x be the side length. Then, (x/2)^2 + (x/2)^2 = 2^2.\nStep 3: Simplify the equation to x^2 = 8\nStep 4: Solve for x: x = \u221a8 = \u221a(4*2) = 2\u221a2. The side length of the square is 2\u221a2 units.\nStep 5: The area of a square is given by A = s^2, where s is the side length. So, A = (2\u221a2)^2 = 8.\nStep 6: A = 8 square units.\nStep 7: The area of the square is A = s^2 = (2\u221a2)^2 = 8 square units.\nStep 6: A = (2\u221a2)^2 = 8 square units.\nA = (2\u221a2)^2 = 8 square units is incorrect. The correct step is:\nA = (2\u221a2)^2 = (2^2)*(\u221a2)^2 = 4*2 = 8 square units is incorrect. The correct step is:\nA = (2\u221a2)^2 = (2*2)*\u221a2 = 4*\u221a2\nA = 4 * \u221a2\nFinal Answer",
