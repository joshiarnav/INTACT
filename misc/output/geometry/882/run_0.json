    "solution": "Since the measure of each interior angle of the octagon is the same, each measures $(8-2)(180^\\circ)/8 = 135^\\circ$.  We extend sides $\\overline{AB}, \\overline{CD}, \\overline{EF}$, and $\\overline{GH}$ to form a rectangle: let $X$ be the intersection of lines $GH$ and $AB$; $Y$ that of $AB$ and $CD$; $Z$ that of $CD$ and $EF$; and $W$ that of $EF$ and $GH$.\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,D,EE,F,G,H,WW,X,Y,Z;\nWW = (0,0);\nG = (0,sqrt(2));\nH = G + (0,2);\nX = H + (0,1+2*sqrt(2));\nA = X + (1+2*sqrt(2),0);\nB = A + (1,0);\nY = B + (sqrt(2), 0);\nC = Y + (0,-sqrt(2));\nD = C - (0,3);\nZ = D - (0,2*sqrt(2));\nEE = Z - (2*sqrt(2),0);\nF = EE - (2,0);\ndraw(F--WW--X--Y--Z--F--G);\ndraw(H--A);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(D--EE);\nlabel(\"$W$\",WW,SW);\nlabel(\"$G$\",G,W);\nlabel(\"$H$\",H,W);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,NW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$Y$\",Y,NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$Z$\",Z,SE);\nlabel(\"$E$\",EE,S);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\n[/asy]\n\n\n\n\nAs $BC=2$, we have $BY=YC = \\sqrt{2}$. As $DE=4$, we have $DZ=ZE = 2\\sqrt{2}$. As $FG=2$, we have $FW=WG=\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe can compute the dimensions of the rectangle: $WX = YZ = YC+CD+DZ = 3+3\\sqrt{2}$, and $XY = ZW = ZE+EF+FW = 2+3\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, $HX = XA = XY - AB-BY = 1+2\\sqrt{2}$, and so $AH = \\sqrt{2}HX = 4+\\sqrt{2}$, and $GH = WX - WG - HX = 2.$ The perimeter of the octagon can now be computed by adding up all its sides, which turns out to be $\\boxed{20+\\sqrt{2}}$.",
