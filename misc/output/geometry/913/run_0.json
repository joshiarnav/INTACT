The circle's area is \\[(2\\sqrt{2})^2\\pi=8\\pi,\\]so the sector's area is \\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot 8\\pi = 4\\sqrt{2}\\pi.\\]Summing the lateral area and the base area gives a total surface area of ${4\\sqrt{2}\\pi+4\\pi}$, so its total surface area is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{2} + 4}$ times $\\pi$.",
