    "solution": "The smallest circle has radius 2, so the next largest circle has radius 4.  The area inside the circle of radius 4 not inside the circle of radius 2 is equal to the difference: $$\\pi\\cdot4^2-\\pi\\cdot2^2=16\\pi-4\\pi=12\\pi$$ This area has been divided into twelve small congruent sections by the radii shown, and the shaded region is one of these.
