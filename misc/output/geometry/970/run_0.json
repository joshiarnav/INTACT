    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "By the Triangle Inequality, each of $x$ and $y$ can be any number strictly between 2 and 10, so $0\\le |x-y|<8$. Therefore, the smallest positive number that is not a possible value of $|x-y|$ is $10-2=\\boxed{8}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: The problem involves finding the smallest positive number that is not a possible value of the absolute difference between the sides of two triangles with specific side lengths. Let's consider the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\nStep 2: The triangle inequality implies that for the first triangle, we must have $x+4>6, x+6>4$, and $4+6>x$. Simplifying these, we get $x>2, x>-2$, and $x<12$. For the second triangle, the inequalities are $y+4>6, y+6>4$, and $4+6>y$, which simplify to $y>2, y>-2$, and $y<12$.\nStep 3: The possible values for $|x-y|$ are the positive integers that differ by at most $4$ and at least $2$ from the possible values of $x-y$, so the numbers that are not possible values of $|x-y|$ are the integers that differ from these possible values by more than $2$ or by more than $4$.\nStep 4: The numbers that are not possible values of $|x-y|$ are those that are more than $4$ units from each other, such as $10, 12, 14, 16, 18$, and so on, as well as $1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17$.\nStep 5: The smallest positive number that is not a possible value of $|x-y|$ is $\\boxed{12}$.\nThe smallest positive number that is not a possible value of |x-y| can be calculated by testing the values that are 4 units away from each other, such as 2, 14, 18, and so on, as well as the values that are 2 units away from each other, such as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17.\nThe numbers that are not possible values of $|x-y|$ are those that are more than $4$ units from each other, such as $10, 12, 14, 16, 18$, and so on, as well as $1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17$.\nStep 6: The smallest number that cannot be written as $|x-y|$ is the smallest number that is at least 4 units away from the possible values of $x-y$.\nThe smallest number that cannot be written as $|x-y|$ is the smallest number that is in the set $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17\\}$ or the set $\\{10, 12, 14, 16, 18, ...\\}$.\nStep 7: Since $|x-y|=10$ is a possible value, we need to consider values larger than 10 that are not possible values of $|x-y|$, such as 12, 14, 16, and so on.",
