    "solution": "We see that $\\triangle ABX \\sim \\triangle ACB$ since $\\angle BXA = \\angle ABC$ and $\\angle A$ is shared by both triangles. From this similarity, we have the equation $\\frac{AB}{AC}=\\frac{AX}{AB}$. Plugging in the known values of the sides and solving for $AX$, we have $\\frac{6}{10}=\\frac{AX}{6}\\Rightarrow AX=3.6$. Since $AM=10/2=5$, $XM=5-3.6=\\boxed{1.4}$ centimeters.",
