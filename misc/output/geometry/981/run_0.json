    "solution": "Since $\\triangle ABE$ is equilateral, we have $\\angle ABE=60^\\circ$.  Therefore, $$\\angle PBC= \\angle ABC - \\angle ABE = 90^\\circ-60^\\circ=30^\\circ.$$ Since $AB=BC$, we know that $\\triangle ABC$ is a right isosceles triangle and $\\angle BAC=\\angle BCA=45^\\circ$.  Then, $\\angle BCP =\\angle BCA=45^\\circ$.\n\nTriangle $BPQ$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle. Thus, $\\frac{BQ}{PQ}=\\frac{BQ}{x}=\\sqrt{3}$, so $BQ=x\\sqrt{3}$.  In $\\triangle PQC$, we have $\\angle QCP=45^\\circ$ and $\\angle PQC=90^\\circ$, so $\\angle CPQ=45^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\triangle PQC$ is isosceles and $QC=PQ=x$.\n\nSince $BC=4$ we have $BC=BQ+QC=x\\sqrt{3}+x=4$, so $x(\\sqrt{3}+1)=4$ and $x=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}+1}$.  Rationalizing the denominator gives  \\begin{align*}x&=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}+1}\\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{3}-1}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{3-1}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{2}\\\\\n&=2(\\sqrt{3}-1)=\\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}-2}.\\end{align*}",
