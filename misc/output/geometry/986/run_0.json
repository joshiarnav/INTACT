    "solution": "Angles $BAC$ and $BCA$ are each inscribed angles, so each one is equal to half of the measure of the arc they subtend. Therefore, the measures of arcs $AB$ and $BC$ are each 70 degrees, and together, the measure of arc $ABC$ is 140 degrees. Notice that angle $CDA$ is also an inscribed angle, and it subtends arc $ABC$, so $m\\angle CDA = \\frac{1}{2} (\\text{arc } ABC) = (1/2)(140) = \\boxed{70}$ degrees.",
