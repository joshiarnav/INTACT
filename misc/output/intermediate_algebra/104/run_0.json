    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We get that $-9 \\le x < -8,$ so multiplying by $5$ gives $-45 \\le 5x < -40.$ Hence, the possible values for $\\lfloor 5x \\rfloor$ are $-45, -44, -43, -42, -41,$ of which there are $\\boxed{5}.$",

This means $x$ lies in the interval $[-9,-8)$ because the floor function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ returns the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.\nStep 2:  We can multiply the entire interval $[-9,-8)$ by $5$ to find the interval for $5x$, which is $[-45,-40)$.\n\nFinal Answer.",
