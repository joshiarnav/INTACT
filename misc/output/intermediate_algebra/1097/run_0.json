    "problem": "Find the equation of the vertical asymptote of the graph of $\\frac{3x^2+16x+5}{2x^2+7x-c}$, if the graph has a hole at $x=-5$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We can factor the numerator to get $$\\frac{3x^2+16x+5}{2x^2+7x-c} = \\frac{(x+5)(3x+1)}{2x^2+7x-c}.$$Since there is a hole at $x=-5$ (rather than an asymptote), we must have a factor of $x+5$ in the denominator that cancels out with the corresponding factor in the numerator. So by the Factor theorem,\n$$2(-5)^2+7(-5)-c = 0$$which we can solve for $c$ to get $c = 15$.\nThen the denominator is $2x^2+7x-15$ which can be factored as $(2x-3)(x+5)$. Hence, the vertical asymptote is given by $\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Factor the denominator to identify potential vertical asymptotes and holes.\nWe need to factor the denominator $2x^2+7x-c$ to determine the values of $x$ that would make the denominator equal to zero, which in turn could be vertical asymptotes or holes.\n## Step 2: Factor $2x^2+7x-c$ completely to identify the value of c that makes x=-5 a hole.\nWe know that x=-5 is a hole, which means that x=-5 must be a zero of the numerator. The factored form is $2x^2+7x-c=(x+5)(2x+a)$, and the constant term must be -10a. Since x=-5 is a zero of the numerator, substituting x=-5 into the numerator yields 3(-5)^2+16(-5)+5=0. Simplifying the equation yields -55=-10a, so a=11. Therefore, the denominator factors as $(x+5)(2x+11)$, and c=-22.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{11}{2}}$",
