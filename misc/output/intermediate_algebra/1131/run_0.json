    "solution": "There are factors of $x + 5,$ $x + 1,$ and $x$ in both the numerator and denominator, and the factors in the denominator cancel the factors in the numerator, so the graph has a hole at $x = -5,$ $x = -1,$ and $x = 0.$\n\nThere is a factor of $x + 7$ in the denominator, so there is a vertical asymptote at $x = -7.$  There are three factors of $x - 3$ in the denominator and two factors of $x - 3$ in the numerator, so there is a vertical asymptote at $x = 3.$  There is a factor of $x - 4$ in the denominator, so there is a vertical asymptote at $x = 4.$\n\nHence, there are $\\boxed{3}$ vertical asymptotes.",
