    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We have\n$$f(x) = q(x)(x^2-1) + r(x),$$where $q(x)$ is the quotient and $r(x)$ is the remainder. Since $x^2-1$ is quadratic, the remainder is at most linear; let us write $r(x) = ax+b$.\n\nObserve that $x=-1$ and $x=1$ are both zeroes of $x^2-1$. Thus $f(1)=r(1)$ and $f(-1)=r(-1)$.\n\nWe can use the given formula for $f(x)$ to compute $f(1)=-10$ and $f(-1)=16$. Thus we have the system of equations\n$$\\begin{cases}\n-10 = a\\cdot (1) + b,\\\\\n\\phantom{-}16 = a\\cdot (-1) + b.\n\\end{cases}$$Adding these equations yields $6=2b$ and hence $b=3$. Substituting into either equation then yields $a=-13$.\n\nTherefore, $r(x) = ax+b = \\boxed{-13x+3}$.",
