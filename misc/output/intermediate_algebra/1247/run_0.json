    "problem": "For some real numbers $a$ and $b$, the equation \\[\n8x^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx + a = 0\n\\]has three distinct positive roots. If the sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots is 5, what is the value of $a$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $r_1, r_2$, and $r_3$ be the roots. Then \\[\n5= \\log_2r_1 + \\log_2 r_2 + \\log_2 r_3 = \\log_2r_1r_2r_3,\n\\]so $r_1r_2r_3 = 2^5 = 32$. Since \\[\n8x^{3}+4ax^{2}+2bx+a=8(x-r_1)(x-r_2)(x-r_3),\n\\]it follows that $a = -8r_1r_2r_3= \\boxed{-256}$.",
