    "solution": "Clearly, $x = 0$ is not a root.  We can divide the equation by $x^3,$ to get\n\\[x^3 + x - 115 + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^3} = 0.\\]Let $y = x + \\frac{1}{x}.$  Then\n\\[y^3 = x^3 + 3x + \\frac{3}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^3},\\]so\n\\[x^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} = y^3 - 3 \\left( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = y^3 - 3y.\\]Thus, our equation becomes\n\\[y^3 - 3y + y - 115 = 0,\\]or $y^3 - 2y - 115 = 0.$  This equation factors as $(y - 5)(y^2 + 5y + 23) = 0.$  The quadratic factor has no real roots, so $y = 5.$  Then\n\\[x + \\frac{1}{x} = 5,\\]or $x^2 - 5x + 1 = 0.$  This quadratic does have real roots, and by Vieta's formulas, their sum is $\\boxed{5}.$",
