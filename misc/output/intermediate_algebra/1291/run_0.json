    "problem": "A square region $ABCD$ is externally tangent to the circle with equation $x^2+y^2=1$ at the point $(0,1)$ on the side $CD$.  Vertices $A$ and $B$ are on the circle with equation $x^2+y^2=4$.  The side length of this square can be expressed in the form $\\frac{a\\sqrt{b}-c}{d}$, where $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, and $a$, $c$, and $d$ share no common factors. Find $a+b+c+d$.",

The circles have radii of $1$ and $2$. We can then draw the triangle shown in the figure above and write expressions for the sides of the triangle in terms of $s$. Because $AO$ is the radius of the larger circle, which is equal to $2$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem: \\begin{align*} \\left( \\frac{s}{2} \\right) ^2 + (s+1)^2 &= 2^2\\\\\n\\frac14 s^2 + s^2 + 2s + 1 &= 4\\\\\n\\frac54 s^2 +2s - 3 &= 0\\\\\n5s^2 + 8s - 12 &=0.\n\\end{align*}Finally, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $s$: $$s = \\frac{-8+\\sqrt{8^2-4(5)(-12)}}{10} = \\frac{-8+\\sqrt{304}}{10} = \\frac{-8+4\\sqrt{19}}{10} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{19}-4}{5}.$$Thus, our answer is $2+19+4+5=\\boxed{30}$.",
