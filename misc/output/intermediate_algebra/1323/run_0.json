    "problem": "Suppose the function $f(x,y,z)=xyz$ is defined for $x+y+z=7$, $x,y,z \\ge 0$. What is the range of $f$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $x,y,z \\ge 0$, we have by the AM-GM inequality that\n\\[\\sqrt[3]{xyz} \\le \\frac{x+y+z}{3} = \\frac{7}{3}.\\]Thus $xyz \\le \\frac{7^3}{3^3}=\\frac{343}{27},$ with equality at $x = y = z = \\frac{7}{3}.$\n\nAlso, $xyz \\ge 0,$ so the range is $\\boxed{\\left[0,\\frac{343}{27}\\right]}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Recognize that the function is a product of three variables, and the constraint is a linear equation involving the variables $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\n(Note: The next steps would involve analyzing the constraint and determining the possible values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy it, and then finding the maximum and minimum values of the function.)\nStep 2: Rewrite the constraint $x+y+z=7$ as $z=7-x-y$ and substitute this expression into the function $f(x,y,z)=xyz$ to obtain $f(x,y)=xy(7-x-y)$, which simplifies to $f(x,y)=-x^2-xy-y^2+7x+7y$.\nStep 3: Rewrite the function as $f(x,y) = -(x^2 + xy + y^2) + 7x + 7y$.\nStep 4: To find the maximum value of $f(x,y)$, consider rewriting it in terms of the quadratic form $-(x+y)^2 + 7(x+y)$, which can be factored as $-(x+y)^2+7(x+y)=-\\left(x+y-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2+\\frac{49}{4}$.\nStep 5: This quadratic form is maximized when $x+y=\\frac{7}{2}$, and the maximum value is $\\frac{49}{4}$.\nStep 6: The minimum value occurs when $x+y=0$, which gives $x=y=0$ and $z=7$.
