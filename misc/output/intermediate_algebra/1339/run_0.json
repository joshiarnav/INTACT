Lines $AB$, $AC$, and $BC$ intersect the graph again at points $D$, $E$, and $F$, respectively, and the sum of the $x$-coordinates of $D$, $E$, and $F$ is 24. What is $f(0)$?",

    "solution": "Since the graph of $y = f(x)$ passes through $(2,4),$ $(3,9),$ and $(4,16),$ $f(2) = 4,$ $f(3) = 9,$ and $f(4) = 16.$\n\nLet $g(x) = f(x) - x^2.$  Then $g(x)$ is cubic, and $g(2) = g(3) = g(4) = 0,$ so\n\\[g(x) = c(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)\\]for some constant $c.$  Then\n\\[f(x) = g(x) + x^2 = cx^3 + (1 - 9c)x^2 + 26cx - 24c.\\]Let $d,$ $e,$ $f$ be the $x$-coordinates of the points $D,$ $E,$ $F,$ respectively.  Let $L(x)$ be the equation of the line passing through $A,$ $B,$ and $D.$  Then the solutions to $f(x) = L(x)$ are $x = 2,$ 3, and $d.$  By Vieta's formulas,\n\\[2 + 3 + d = -\\frac{1 - 9c}{c}.\\](Note that the $x^3$ and $x^2$ terms of $f(x) - L(x)$ are the same as those in $f(x).$)\n\nSimilarly,\n\\begin{align*}\n2 + 4 + e &= -\\frac{1 - 9c}{c}, \\\\\n3 + 4 + f &= -\\frac{1 - 9c}{c}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these equations, we get\n\\[d + e + f + 18 = -\\frac{3(1 - 9c)}{c}.\\]We are told that $d + e + f = 24,$ so\n\\[42 = -\\frac{3(1 - 9c)}{c}.\\]Solving for $c,$ we find $c = -\\frac{1}{5}.$  Hence,\n\\[f(x) = -\\frac{1}{5} (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) + x^2.\\]It follows that $f(0) = \\boxed{\\frac{24}{5}}.$",
