    "solution": "Note that $p(x) = 2x$ for $x = -3,$ 4, and 5, so we consider the polynomial\n\\[q(x) = p(x) - 2x,\\]which is cubic.\n\nThen $q(-3) = q(4) = q(5) = 0,$ so $q(x)$ is of the form\n\\[q(x) = c(x + 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)\\]for some constant $c$.  Furthermore, $q(7) = 15 - 2 \\cdot 7 = 1,$ and\n\\[q(7) = c(7 + 3)(7 - 4)(7 - 5) = 60c,\\]so $c = \\frac{1}{60}.$  Hence,\n\\[q(x) = \\frac{(x + 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)}{60}.\\]In particular,\n\\[q(12) = \\frac{(12 + 3)(12 - 4)(12 - 5)}{60} = 14,\\]so $p(12) = q(12) + 2 \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{38}.$",
