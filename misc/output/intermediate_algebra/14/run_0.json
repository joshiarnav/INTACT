    "solution": "For the hyperbola $\\mathcal{H},$ we have $a=3$ and $c=5,$ so $b= \\sqrt{c^2-a^2} = 4.$ Thus, the hyperbola has equation \\[\\frac{x^2}{3^2} - \\frac{y^2}{4^2} = 1,\\]or \\[16x^2 - 9y^2 = 144.\\]Meanwhile, the equation for the circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 16.$ To find the points of intersection, we solve these two equations simultaneously. Adding $9$ times the second equation to the first equation gives $25x^2 = 288,$ so $x = \\pm \\frac{12\\sqrt2}{5}.$ Then we have \\[y^2 = 16 - x^2 = 16 - \\frac{288}{25} = \\frac{112}{25},\\]so $y = \\pm \\frac{4\\sqrt7}{5}.$ Therefore, the four points of intersection form a rectangle with side lengths $\\frac{24\\sqrt2}{5}$ and $\\frac{8\\sqrt7}{5},$ so its area is $\\frac{24\\sqrt2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8\\sqrt7}{5} = \\boxed{\\frac{192\\sqrt{14}}{25}}.$\n[asy]\nvoid axes(real x0, real x1, real y0, real y1)\n{\n\tdraw((x0,0)--(x1,0),EndArrow);\n    draw((0,y0)--(0,y1),EndArrow);\n    label(\"$x$\",(x1,0),E);\n    label(\"$y$\",(0,y1),N);\n    for (int i=floor(x0)+1; i<x1; ++i)\n    \tdraw((i,.1)--(i,-.1));\n    for (int i=floor(y0)+1; i<y1; ++i)\n    \tdraw((.1,i)--(-.1,i));\n}\npath[] yh(real a, real b, real h, real k, real x0, real x1, bool upper=true, bool lower=true, pen color=black)\n{\n\treal f(real x) { return k + a / b * sqrt(b^2 + (x-h)^2); }\n    real g(real x) { return k - a / b * sqrt(b^2 + (x-h)^2); }\n    if (upper) { draw(graph(f, x0, x1),color,  Arrows); }\n    if (lower) { draw(graph(g, x0, x1),color,  Arrows); }\n    path [] arr = {graph(f, x0, x1), graph(g, x0, x1)};\n    return arr;\n}\nvoid xh(real a, real b, real h, real k, real y0, real y1, bool right=true, bool left=true, pen color=black)\n{\n\tpath [] arr = yh(a, b, k, h, y0, y1, false, false);\n    if (right) draw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*arr[0],color,  Arrows);\n    if (left) draw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*arr[1],color,  Arrows);\n}\nvoid e(real a, real b, real h, real k)\n{\n\tdraw(shift((h,k))*scale(a,b)*unitcircle);\n}\nsize(8cm);\naxes(-6,6,-6,6);\nxh(3,4,0,0,-5,5);\ne(4,4,0,0);\ndot((5,0)^^(-5,0)^^(3,0)^^(-3,0));\nfor (int i=-1; i<=1; i+=2)\n\tfor (int j=-1; j<=1; j+=2)\n    \tdot((i*12*sqrt(2)/5,j*4*sqrt(7)/5));\ndraw((-1*12*sqrt(2)/5,-1*4*sqrt(7)/5)--(12*sqrt(2)/5,-1*4*sqrt(7)/5)--(12*sqrt(2)/5,4*sqrt(7)/5)--(-12*sqrt(2)/5,4*sqrt(7)/5)--cycle,dotted);\n[/asy]",
