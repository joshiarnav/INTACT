    "solution": "Dividing the equation of the ellipse by $225,$ we get \\[\\frac{x^2}{9} + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1.\\]Therefore, the semi-major axis has length $\\sqrt{25} = 5$ and is vertical, while the semi-minor axis has length $\\sqrt{9} = 3$ and is horizontal. This means that the endpoints of the major axis are $(0, \\pm 5).$ Also, the distance from each focus of the ellipse to the center (the origin) is $\\sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = 4,$ so the foci of the ellipse are at $(0, \\pm 4).$\n\nNow, we know that the hyperbola has its vertices at $(0, \\pm 4)$ and its foci at $(0, \\pm 5).$ Since these points all lie along the $y-$axis, the equation of the hyperbola must take the form \\[\\frac{y^2}{a^2}-\\frac{x^2}{b^2}=1\\](as opposed to $\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$). Since the vertices are at $(0, \\pm 4),$ we have $a = 4.$ The distance from each focus to the center of the hyperbola (the origin) is $c = 5,$ so we have $b = \\sqrt{c^2-a^2} = 3.$ Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is \\[\\frac{y^2}{16} - \\frac{x^2}{9} = 1,\\]or $9y^2 - 16x^2 = 144.$\n[asy]\nvoid axes(real x0, real x1, real y0, real y1)\n{\n\tdraw((x0,0)--(x1,0),EndArrow);\n    draw((0,y0)--(0,y1),EndArrow);\n    label(\"$x$\",(x1,0),E);\n    label(\"$y$\",(0,y1),N);\n    for (int i=floor(x0)+1; i<x1; ++i)\n    \tdraw((i,.1)--(i,-.1));\n    for (int i=floor(y0)+1; i<y1; ++i)\n    \tdraw((.1,i)--(-.1,i));\n}\npath[] yh(real a, real b, real h, real k, real x0, real x1, bool upper=true, bool lower=true, pen color=black)\n{\n\treal f(real x) { return k + a / b * sqrt(b^2 + (x-h)^2); }\n    real g(real x) { return k - a / b * sqrt(b^2 + (x-h)^2); }\n    if (upper) { draw(graph(f, x0, x1),color,  Arrows); }\n    if (lower) { draw(graph(g, x0, x1),color,  Arrows); }\n    path [] arr = {graph(f, x0, x1), graph(g, x0, x1)};\n    return arr;\n}\nvoid xh(real a, real b, real h, real k, real y0, real y1, bool right=true, bool left=true, pen color=black)\n{\n\tpath [] arr = yh(a, b, k, h, y0, y1, false, false);\n    if (right) draw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*arr[0],color,  Arrows);\n    if (left) draw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*arr[1],color,  Arrows);\n}\nvoid e(real a, real b, real h, real k)\n{\n\tdraw(shift((h,k))*scale(a,b)*unitcircle);\n}\nsize(7cm);\naxes(-5,5,-6,6);\ne(3,5,0,0);\ndot((0,4)^^(0,-4)^^(0,5)^^(0,-5));\nyh(4,3,0,0,-3,3);\ndot((9/sqrt(41),20*sqrt(2)/sqrt(41)));\n[/asy]\nNow we want to solve the system \\[\\begin{aligned} 25x^2 + 9y^2 &= 225, \\\\ 9y^2 - 16x^2 &= 144. \\end{aligned}\\]Subtracting these equations, we get $41x^2 = 81,$ so $x^2 = \\frac{81}{41}.$ That is, the coordinates $(s, t)$ of the intersection point satisfy $s^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{81}{41}}.$",
