Then the next term is $2(x - 1) = 2x - 2,$ and the next term after that is $2x - 2 + 1 = 2x - 1.$\n\nThis confirms that in the sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, $\\dots,$ each term is double the previous term.  Then the 50th term in this geometric sequence is $3 \\cdot 2^{49},$ so the 100th term in the original sequence is $3 \\cdot 2^{49} - 1,$ so $k = \\boxed{49}.$",
