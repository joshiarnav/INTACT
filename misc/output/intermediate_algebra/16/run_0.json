    "solution": "The $y$-coordinate of the vertex is negative, and there are two $x$-intercepts, so the parabola must be upward facing, which means that $a$ must be positive.    Furthermore, one $x$-intercept is positive and the other is negative, so the $y$-intercept $c$ must be negative.\n\nThe $x$-coordinate of the vertex is positive, which is also $-\\frac{b}{2a}.$  Since $a$ is positive, $b$ is negative.\n\nTherefore, the only coefficient that must be positive is $\\boxed{a}.$",
