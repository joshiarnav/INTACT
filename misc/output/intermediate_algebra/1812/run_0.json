We notice that the last three digits repeat after every fourth power: $11^1\\equiv 11\\pmod{1000}$, $11^2\\equiv 121\\pmod{1000}$, $11^3\\equiv 11\\cdot 121\\equiv 331\\pmod{1000}$, and $11^4\\equiv 11\\cdot 331\\equiv 361\\pmod{1000}$. This pattern repeats every 4 powers of $11$.\nStep 3:  Since we are looking for the hundreds digit of $2011^{2011}$, we can consider the powers of $11$ in modulo $1000$ to find the repeating pattern.
