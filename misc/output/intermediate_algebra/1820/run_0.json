    "solution": "If $m > 0,$ then the graph of $x^2+my^2 = 4$ is an ellipse centered at the origin. The endpoints of the horizontal axis are $(\\pm 2,0),$ while the endpoints of the vertical axis are $\\left(0, \\pm \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{m}}\\right).$ If $m < 1,$ then the vertical axis is longer, so it is the major axis, and the distance from the foci to the origin is \\[\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{m}}\\right)^2 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{m} - 4}.\\]Since the foci lie on the circle $x^2+y^2=16,$ which has radius $4$ and is centered at the origin, we must have \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{4}{m}-4} = 4\\]which gives $m = \\frac{1}{5}.$ If $m>1,$ then the horizontal axis is longer, so it is the major axis. But the endpoints of the horizontal axis are $(\\pm 2, 0),$ so it is impossible that the foci of the ellipse are $4$ units away from the origin in this case.\n\nIf $m<0,$ then the graph of $x^2+my^2 = 4$ is a hyperbola centered at the origin, with the vertices on the $x-$axis. Its standard form is \\[\\frac{x^2}{2^2} - \\frac{y^2}{\\left(\\sqrt{-\\frac {4}m}\\,\\right)^2} = 1,\\]so the distance from the foci to the origin is \\[\\sqrt{2^2 + \\left(\\sqrt{-\\frac {4}m}\\,\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{4 - \\frac{4}{m}}.\\]Therefore, we must have $\\sqrt{4 - \\frac{4}{m}} = 4,$ which gives $m=-\\frac{1}{3}.$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $m$ are $m = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}, -\\frac{1}{3}}.$",
