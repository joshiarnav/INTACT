    "solution": "First, note that if $k < 0,$ then $\\log(kx)$ is defined for $x \\in (-\\infty, 0),$ and is strictly decreasing on that interval. Since $2\\log(x+2)$ is defined for $x \\in (-2, \\infty)$ and is strictly increasing on that interval, it follows that $\\log(kx) = 2\\log(x+2)$ has exactly one real solution, which must lie in the interval $(-2, 0).$ Therefore, all the values $k = -500, -499, \\ldots, -2, -1$ satisfy the condition.\n\nIf $k = 0,$ then the left-hand side is never defined, so we may assume now that $k > 0.$ In this case, converting to exponential form, we have \\[ kx = (x+2)^2\\]or \\[x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0.\\]Any solution of this equation satisfies $\\log(kx) = 2\\log(x+2)$ as well, as long as the two logarithms are defined; since $k > 0,$ the logarithms are defined exactly when $x > 0.$ Therefore, this quadratic must have exactly one positive root.\n\nBut by Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of this quadratic is $4,$ which is positive, so the only way for it to have exactly one positive root is if it has $\\sqrt{4} = 2$ as a double root. That is, \\[x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = (x-2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4\\]for all $x,$ so $4-k=-4,$ and $k=8,$ which is the only positive value of $k$ satisfying the condition.\n\nIn total, there are $500 + 1 = \\boxed{501}$ values of $k$ satisfying the condition.",
