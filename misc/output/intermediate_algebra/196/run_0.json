    "solution": "The graph has a horizontal asymptote $y = 0,$ a hole at $x=1$, and a vertical asymptote at $x=2$. Since $q(x)$ is a quadratic, and we have a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0,$ $p(x)$ must be linear (have degree 1).\n\nSince we have a hole at $x=1$, there must be a factor of $x-1$ in both $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. Lastly, since there is a vertical asymptote at $x=2$, the denominator $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x-2$. Since $q(x)$ is quadratic, we know that $q(x) = b(x-1)(x-2)$ for some $b.$ It follows that $p(x) = a(x-1),$ for some constant $a.$ Since $p(2) = 2$, we have $a(2-1) = 2$ and $a=2.$ Since $q(-1) = 18,$ we have $b(-1-1)(-1-2) = 18$ and hence $b=3.$\n\nSo $p(x) = 2(x - 1) = 2x - 2$ and $q(x) = 3(x - 1)(x - 2) = 3x^2 - 9x + 6,$ so $p(x) + q(x) = \\boxed{3x^2 - 7x + 4}.$",
