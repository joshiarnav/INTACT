Thus, we want to solve the inequality\n\\[-4y^2 + 8y - 3 \\ge 0.\\]We can factor this as\n\\[-(2y - 3)(2y - 1) \\ge 0.\\]The solution to this inequality is $\\frac{1}{2} \\le y \\le \\frac{3}{2}.$  Note that this interval includes the value of $p(0) = 1$ that we found above, so the range of the function is $\\boxed{\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} \\right]}.$",
