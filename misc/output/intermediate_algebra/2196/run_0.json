    "solution": "Clearly, the maximum occurs when $x$ is positive and $y$ is negative.  Let $z = -y,$ so $z$ is positive, and $y = -z.$  Then\n\\[\\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6} = \\frac{x + z}{x^4 + z^4 + 6}.\\]By AM-GM,\n\\[x^4 + 1 + 1 + 1 \\ge 4 \\sqrt[4]{x^4} = 4x,\\]and\n\\[z^4 + 1 + 1 + 1 \\ge 4 \\sqrt[4]{z^4} = 4z.\\]Then $x^4 + z^4 + 6 \\ge 4(x + z),$ which implies\n\\[\\frac{x + z}{x^4 + z^4 + 6} \\le \\frac{1}{4}.\\]Equality occurs when $x = z = 1,$ so the maximum value is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}.$",
