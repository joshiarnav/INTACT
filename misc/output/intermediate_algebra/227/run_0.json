    "problem": "The function $f(x) = \\frac{6x^3+4x^2-11x+5}{3x^3-15x+20}$ has a horizontal asymptote $y = c$.  What is $c$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "When the degree (largest exponent) of the polynomial on the numerator and denominator are the same, the horizontal asymptote approaches the ratio of the leading coefficient of the numerator to the leading coefficient of the denominator. In this case, the ratio is $\\frac{6}{3} = \\boxed{2}$.",
