    "solution": "First, there are $5! = 120$ 5-digit numbers that can be formed from the digits 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8.  The units digit is equal to 1 in $\\frac{1}{5}$ of these numbers.  The units digits is also equal to 3 in $\\frac{1}{5}$ of these numbers, and the same holds for the digits 5, 7, and 8.  The same holds for the tens digits, hundreds digits, thousands digits, and ten thousands digits.  Therefore, the mean of all 120 5-digit numbers is\n\\[11111 \\cdot \\frac{1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 8}{5} = \\boxed{\\frac{266664}{5}}.\\]",

The average for the thousands place is (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 8)/5 = 24/5 = 4.8, for the hundreds place is (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 8)/5 = 24/5 = 4.8, for the tens place is (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 8)/5 = 24/5 = 4.8, and for the ones place is (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 8)/5 = 24/5 = 4.8.\nStep 3: The average of all 5-digit numbers that can be formed is the sum of the average of each place value position, which is (4.8 \u00d7 10000) + (4.8 \u00d7 1000) + (4.8 \u00d7 100) + (4.8 \u00d7 10) + (4.8 \u00d7 1)\nStep 4: Calculate (4.8 \u00d7 10000) + (4.8 \u00d7 1000) + (4.8 \u00d7 100) + (4.8 \u00d7 10) + (4.8 \u00d7 1) = 48000 + 4800 + 480 + 48 + 4.8\nStep 5: Calculate 48000 + 4800 + 480 + 48 + 4.8 = 52132.8\nStep 6: Round the result 52132.8 to the nearest whole number.\nStep 6: 52233\nStep 6: 52233",
