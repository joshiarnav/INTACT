    "problem": "If two positive numbers have arithmetic mean $2700$ and harmonic mean $75$, what is their geometric mean?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the two numbers be $a$ and $b$. If they have arithmetic mean $2700,$ then\n$$\\frac{a+b}{2} = 2700,$$which gives us $a+b = 5400$. Since their harmonic mean is $75$ we have\n$$\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}}=75.$$We can rearrange terms to get\n$$\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}=\\frac{2}{75}.$$Taking the common denominator gives us\n$$\\frac{a+b}{ab} = \\frac{2}{75}.$$Substituting the value of $a+b$ and solving for $ab$ gives\n$$ab = \\frac{5400\\cdot75}{2} = 2700\\cdot75.$$Then the geometric mean is\n$$\\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{2700\\cdot75} = \\boxed{450}.$$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let $a$ and $b$ be the two positive numbers. The arithmetic mean of two numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by $2$. Therefore, $\\frac{a+b}{2}=2700$.\nThe harmonic mean of two numbers is 2 divided by the sum of the reciprocals of the numbers. Therefore, $\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}}=75$.\nThe geometric mean of two numbers is the square root of their product. Therefore, $\\sqrt{ab}=g$, where $g$ is the geometric mean.\nStep 2: Simplifying the equation $\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}}=75$, we obtain $\\frac{2}{\\frac{b+a}{ab}}=75$.\n\nFinal Answer.",
