    "solution": "Suppose the graphs $x^2 + y^2 = k^2$ and $xy = k$ intersect, which means the system\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + y^2 &= k^2, \\\\\nxy &= k\n\\end{align*}has a solution.  Then\n\\[(x - y)^2 \\ge 0.\\]Expanding, we get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \\ge 0,$ so\n\\[k^2 - 2k \\ge 0.\\]This is satisfied by all integers except $k = 1.$\n\nBy the same token, $(x + y)^2 \\ge 0,$ or $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\ge 0.$  Hence,\n\\[k^2 + 2k \\ge 0.\\]This is satisfied by all integers except $k = -1.$  We have found that $k = 1$ and $k = -1$ do not work.\n\nIf $k = 0,$ then $(x,y) = (0,0)$ is a solution.\n\nNow, assume $k \\ge 2.$  The point $(\\sqrt{k},\\sqrt{k})$ lies on the hyperbola $xy = k,$ and its distance from the origin is\n\\[\\sqrt{k + k} = \\sqrt{2k} \\le \\sqrt{k \\cdot k} = k.\\]Since there are points arbitrary far from the origin on the hyperbola $xy = k,$ there must be a point on the hyperbola whose distance from the origin is exactly $k,$ which means it lies on the circle $x^2 + y^2 = k^2.$\n\nFor $k \\le -2,$ the graph of $xy = k$ is the graph of $xy = -k$ rotated $90^\\circ$ about the origin, so the case where $k \\ge 2$ applies, i.e. the hyperbola $xy = k$ and circle $x^2 + y^2 = k^2$ intersect.\n\nHence, the there are $\\boxed{2}$ integer values of $k$ for which the graphs do not intersect, namely 1 and $-1.$",
