    "solution": "The only information we are given about the function $f$ is its value when $x=-2$, namely $f(-2)=3$. Therefore, in order to say something about the value of $f(2x+1)+3$, we need to choose a value of $x$ for which $2x+1=-2$. Solving this linear equation, we get $x=-3/2$. Substituting $x=-3/2$ into $y=f(2x+1)+3$ gives $y=f(-2)+3=6$, so the ordered pair that we can say is on the graph of $y=f(2x+1)+3$ is $\\boxed{(-\\frac{3}{2},6)}$.\n\nRemark: The graph of $y=f(2x+1)+3$ can be obtained from the graph of $y=f(x)$ by the following series of transformations:\n\n(1) Replace $x$ with $2x$, which scales the graph horizontally by a factor of 1/2.\n\n(2) Replace $x$ with $x+1/2$, which shifts the graph $1/2$ units to the left.\n\n(3) Add 3, which shifts the graph up 3 units.\n\nWe can apply this series of transformations (half the $x$-coordinate, subtract 1/2 from the $x$-coordinate, and add 3 to the $y$-coordinate) to the point $(-2,3)$ to get $(-2,3)\\rightarrow (-1,3) \\rightarrow (-3/2,3) \\rightarrow (-3/2,6)$.",
