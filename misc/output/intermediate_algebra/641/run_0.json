This means that every value in the list $f(0),$ $f(1),$ $\\dots,$ $f(999)$ must appear among the values\n\\[f(0), f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(351).\\]The identity $f(x) = f(398 - x)$ implies that every value in the list $f(200),$ $f(201),$ $\\dots,$ $f(351)$ must appear among the values\n\\[f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(199),\\]and the identity $f(x) = f(46 - x)$ implies that every value in the list $f(0),$ $f(1),$ $\\dots,$ $f(22)$ must appear among the values\n\\[f(23), f(24), \\dots, f(199).\\]This implies that $f(23),$ $f(24),$ $\\dots,$ $f(199)$ capture all the possible values of $f(n),$ where $n$ is a positive integer.\n\nNow, let $f(x) = \\cos \\left( \\frac{360}{352} (x - 23) \\right),$ where the cosine is evaluated in terms of degrees.  Then\n\\[1 = f(23) > f(24) > f(25) > \\dots > f(199) = -1,\\]and we can verify that $f(x) = f(398 - x),$ $f(x) = f(2158 - x),$ and $f(x) = f(3214 - x).$\n\nThus, the list $f(0),$ $f(1),$ $\\dots,$ $f(999)$ can have at most $199 - 23 + 1 = \\boxed{177}$ different values.",
