    "solution": "The equation of the tangent is of the form $y - (9 - a^2) = m(x - a).$  Substituting $y = 9 - x^2,$ we get\n\\[9 - x^2 - (9 - a^2) = m(x - a),\\]or $x^2 + mx - ma - a^2 = 0.$  Since we have a tangent, $x = a$ should be a double root of this quadratic.  In other words, the quadratic is identical to $(x - a)^2 = x^2 - 2ax + a^2,$ so $m = -2a.$\n\nThe equation of the tangent is then\n\\[y - (9 - a^2) = (-2a)(x - a).\\]When $x = 0,$\n\\[y - (9 - a^2) = 2a^2,\\]so $y = a^2 + 9,$ which is the height of the triangle.\n\nWhen $y = 0,$\n\\[-(9 - a^2) = (-2a)(x - a),\\]so $x = \\frac{a^2 + 9}{2a},$ which is the base of the triangle.  Hence,\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (a^2 + 9) \\cdot \\frac{a^2 + 9}{2a} = 25.\\]Expanding, we get $a^4 + 18a^2 - 100a + 81 = 0.$\n\nSince $a$ is rational, by the Rational Root Theorem, $a$ must be an integer divisor of 81.  Furthermore, $a$ must lie in the range $0 \\le a \\le 3.$  Checking, we find that $a = \\boxed{1}$ is the only solution.",
