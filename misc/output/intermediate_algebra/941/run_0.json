It follows that \\[\n2^{Ma}\\cdot 3^{Mb}\\cdot 5^{Mc}\\cdot 7^{Md} = 2^{2005M}\\cdot 5^{2005M}.\n\\]Since the exponents are all integers, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic implies that \\[\nMa = 2005M, \\quad Mb = 0, \\quad Mc= 2005M,\\quad\\text{and}\\quad Md = 0.\n\\]Hence the only solution is $(a, b, c, d) = ( 2005, 0, 2005, 0)$, and the answer is $\\boxed{1}$.",
