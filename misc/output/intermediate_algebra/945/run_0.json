    "problem": "Find $q(x)$ if the graph of $\\frac{4x-x^3}{q(x)}$ has a hole at $x=-2$, a vertical asymptote at $x=1$, no horizontal asymptote, and $q(3) = -30$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the graph has no horizontal asymptote, $q(x)$ must have degree less than $3.$ We can factor the numerator of our given function as $4x-x^3 = x(2+x)(2-x).$ Then, since the graph has a hole at $x=-2,$ then $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x+2.$\n\nSince the graph has a vertical asymptote at $x=1,$ it must have a factor of $x-1.$ Hence, $q(x) = a(x+2)(x-1)$ for some constant $a.$\n\nWe know $q(3) = -30.$ Then, $a(3+2)(3-1) = -30,$ which we can solve to get $a=-3.$ Thus, $q(x) = \\boxed{-3(x+2)(x-1)} = -3x^2-3x+6.$",
