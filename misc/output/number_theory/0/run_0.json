    "solution": "The positive multiples of 45 are  \\[45,90,135,\\ldots,990=1\\cdot45,2\\cdot45,3\\cdot45,\\ldots,22\\cdot45.\\] There are 22 multiples on this list. Every positive multiple of 45 less than 1000 is either a two-digit integer or a three-digit integer. Out of the $99-10+1=90$ two-digit integers, $45$ and $90$ are multiples of 45. Therefore, the probability that the selected multiple of 45 has two digits is $2/22=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}}$.",
