    "problem": "What is the largest two-digit number that is divisible by both of its digits, and the digits are distinct?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since we are looking for the largest number, we should start at 99 and work our way down.  No number in the 90s works, because the only numbers divisible by $9$ are $90$ and $99$. $90$ is invalid because no number is divisible by zero, and $99$ is invalid because the digits are the same.  The same reasoning applies to numbers with $8$, $7$, $6$, or $5$ in the tens place.  When we get to the 40s, however, there are three numbers that are divisible by $4$: $40$, $44$, and $48$. $48$ is also divisible by $8$, so the number we are looking for is $\\boxed{48}.$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Start by listing all two-digit numbers in descending order to consider the largest possibilities first.\nStep 2:  Check each number starting from 98, and verify if the sum of the digits is greater than 9, if it is a multiple of one of its digits, and if the digits are distinct.\nStep 3:  Check if 98 is a multiple of 9 and 8, and if the digits are distinct. Since 9 and 8 are both factors of 98, and 9 and 8 are distinct, then 98 is a valid number.\nStep 4:  Now check if 97 is a multiple of 9 and 7, and if the digits are distinct. Since 9 is a factor of 97 and 7 is not, then 97 is not a valid number.\nStep 5:  Next, check if 96 is a multiple of 9 and 6, and if the digits are distinct. Since 9 is a factor of 96, but 6 is not, then 96 is not a valid number.\nStep 6:  Check if 95 is a multiple of 9 and 5, and if the digits are distinct. Since 9 is a factor of 95 and 5 is not, then 95 is not a valid number.\nStep 7:  Check if 94 is a multiple of 9 and 4, and if the digits are distinct. Since 9 is a factor of 94 and 4 is not, then 94 is not a valid number.\nStep 8:  Check if 93 is a multiple of 9 and 3, and if the digits are distinct. Since 9 is a factor of 93 and 3 is not, then 93 is not a valid number.\nStep 9: Check if 92 is a multiple of 9 and 2, and if the digits are distinct.\nStep 10: Check if 92 is a multiple of 9 and 2, and if the digits are distinct.",
