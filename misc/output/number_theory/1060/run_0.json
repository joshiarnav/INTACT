    "problem": "A Chinese emperor orders a regiment of soldiers in his palace to divide into groups of $4$. They do so successfully. He then orders them to divide into groups of $3$, upon which $2$ of them are left without a group. He then orders them to divide into groups of $11$, upon which $5$ are left without a group. If the emperor estimates there are about two hundred soldiers in the regiment, what is the most likely number of soldiers in the regiment?",

    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of soldiers. According to the problem statement, it follows that \\begin{align*}\nn &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} \\\\\nn &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nn &\\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}\n\\end{align*}By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is an unique residue that $n$ can leave, modulo $33$; since $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, it follows that $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{33}$. Also, we know that $n$ is divisible by $4$, so by the Chinese Remainder Theorem again, it follows that $n \\equiv 104 \\pmod{132}$. Writing out the first few positive values of $n$, we obtain that $n = 104, 236, 368$, and so forth. The closest value of $n$ is $\\boxed{236}$.",
