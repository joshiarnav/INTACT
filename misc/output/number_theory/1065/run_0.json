    "solution": "We could find the answer by trial and error -- testing each candidate $t$ to see if $t\\cdot (t+2)\\equiv 1\\pmod{23}$. However, here is another way:\n\nWe can easily see that $4\\cdot 6=24\\equiv 1\\pmod{23}$, so $4$ fulfills the main requirement that its inverse is $2$ more than it. Unfortunately, $4$ isn't odd. But we also have \\begin{align*}\n(-4)\\cdot (-6) &= 4\\cdot 6 \\\\\n&\\equiv 1\\pmod{23},\n\\end{align*} so $-4$ and $-6$ are each other's inverses $\\pmod{23}$. Since $-4\\equiv 19\\pmod{23}$ and $-6\\equiv 17\\pmod{23}$, the answer $t=\\boxed{17}$ satisfies the requirements of the problem.\n\n(We can even check that $17\\cdot 19 = 323 = 14\\cdot 23 + 1$.)",
