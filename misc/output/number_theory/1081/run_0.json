    "problem": "What is the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits such that the digits add up to 20?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For the number to be as small as possible, the leftmost digit should be as small as possible. Therefore, the ten thousandth digit should be $1$. The other four digits would have to add up to $20-1=19$. The leftmost digit is now the thousandth digit, which should be the smallest number possible, $1$. We can also put a $1$ in the hundredths place.  The last two digits then have to add up to $20-1-1-1=17$.  The only single-digit numbers that add to $17$ are $8$ and $9$.  Since $8$ is smaller, that goes in the tens place, and the $9$ goes in the ones place.  Therefore, the smallest five-digit number possible is $\\boxed{11189}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  To find the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits and a sum of 20, we need to start by determining the placement of the digits in the number.\nStep 2:  To minimize the number, we want the leftmost digits to be as small as possible. Since the number must be a five-digit number, we start by placing 9 in the leftmost position because it's the largest non-zero single-digit number.\nStep 2:  Now that we have 9 in the leftmost position, we need to find the sum of the remaining four digits to be 11 (since 20 - 9 = 11). To minimize the number, we place 9 in the second position as well to further minimize the number. This leaves us with 2 for the sum of the remaining three digits.\nStep 3: \nPlace 7 in the third position to minimize the number and make it easier for the last two digits to add up to 2.\nStep 4: \nPlace 1 in the fourth position and 0 in the fifth position to satisfy the condition of non-zero digits and the sum of 20.\nStep 5: \nPlace 0 in the fifth position and 2 in the last remaining position is incorrect as it violates the condition of non-zero digits. Instead, place 1 in the fifth position.\nStep 6: \nPlace 1 in the fifth position.\nStep 7: The number is 91770.\nStep 4: \nPlace 1 in the fourth position and 0 in the fifth position to satisfy the condition of non-zero digits and the sum of 20.",
