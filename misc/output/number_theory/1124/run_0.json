    "problem": "The four-digit number $\\underline{374n}$ is divisible by 18. Find the units digit $n$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We know that the prime factorization of 18 is $2\\cdot 3^2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 as well. Thus, $3+7+4+n$, or $14+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $14+n=18$, and $n=18-14=\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  A number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.\nStep 2:  To be divisible by 2, the number must be even, meaning it must end in an even digit.\nStep 3:  To be divisible by 9, the sum of the number's digits must be divisible by 9, so $3 + 7 + 4 + n$ must be divisible by 9.\nStep 4:  Since the number is even, $n$ must be even, so $n = 0, 2, 4, 6,$ or $8$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's evaluate each of the possibilities for $n$ to see which one works.\nStep 6:  $n = 0:$ $3 + 7 + 4 + 0 = 14$, which is not divisible by 9.\nStep 7:  $n = 2:$ $3 + 7 + 4 + 2 = 16$, which is not divisible by 9.\nStep 8:  $n = 4:$ $3 + 7 + 4 + 4 = 18$, which is divisible by 9.\nStep 9:  Since $n = 4$ satisfies both conditions for divisibility by 18, we have found the correct value of $n$.\nStep 10:  Thus, the units digit $n$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\nStep 11:  $n = 6:$ $3 + 7 + 4 + 6 = 20$, which is not divisible by 9.\n\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4.
