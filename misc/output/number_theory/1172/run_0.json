    "problem": "A book is said to have $n$ leaves if it is composed of $n$ pieces of paper. On the other hand, the number of pages is twice the number of leaves because each side of a piece of paper is defined as a page.\n\nIf the number of pages in a book is $3$ more than a multiple of $7$, and the number of leaves is greater than $100$, then what is the smallest possible number of leaves?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $m$ be the least possible number of leaves. Then $2m$ is the least possible number of pages. We know that $2m\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies 8m \\equiv 3\\cdot 4\\pmod 7\\implies m\\equiv 12\\equiv 5\\pmod 7$. So $m=5+7a$ for some positive integer $a$. The smallest such number greater than $100$ is $5+7\\cdot 14=\\boxed{103}$.",

Since the number of pages is $3$ more than a multiple of $7$, it can be expressed as $2n=7k+3$, where $k$ is an integer. \n\nWe need to solve for the number of leaves when n is greater than 100.\nStep 2: Rewrite the equation $2n=7k+3$ as $2n-3=7k$, and then find the smallest value of $n$ that is greater than $100$ and satisfies the equation.\nStep 3: We need to find the smallest odd multiple of 7 that is greater than 3 and can be written in the form of 2n-3, where n is an integer.\nStep 4: $2n - 3 = 7k$, where $2n-3$ is an odd multiple of 7, so $k$ must be an odd integer.\nStep 5:\nThe smallest odd multiple of $7$ that is greater than $3$ is $7$.
