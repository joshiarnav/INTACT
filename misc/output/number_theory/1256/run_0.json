    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Checking the primes less than $\\sqrt{67}$, namely 2, 3, 5, and 7, as potential divisors, we find that 67 is prime. Thus, $\\frac{67}{2x-23}$ is an integer if and only if $2x-23=\\pm1$ or $2x-23=\\pm67$. The first equation yields $x=12$ or $x=11$ and the second gives $x=45$ or $x=-22$. The sum is $12+11+45-22=\\boxed{46}$.",

We need to analyze the expression $2x - 23$ to determine the conditions under which it will divide evenly into 67.\nStep 2:  In order for the fraction to yield an integer, the expression $2x - 23$ must be a factor of $67$. Since $67$ is a prime number, it only has two factors: $1$ and $67$.\nStep 2:  Therefore, the solutions to the equation $2x - 23 = 1$ are $x = 12$ and $x = -11$. Similarly, the solutions to the equation $2x - 23 = -67$ are $x = -22$ and $x = -3$.\nStep 3: \n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Sum of all integer values of x} &= x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 \\\\\n&= 12 + (-11) + (-22) + (-3) \\\\\n&= -24\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nStep 4:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Sum of all integer values of x} &= -24\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFinal Answer",
