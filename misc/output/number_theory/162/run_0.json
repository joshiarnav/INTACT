    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We know that the five-digit number must be divisible by each of its non-zero digits. We should include the digit zero since it does not have to be included as a possible divisor and it will keep the integer smaller. Knowing this, the least possible five-digit number that we could try is $10,234$. Any number we choose will be divisible by one. We also see that it is even, and therefore, divisible by two. However, the two-digit number formed by its last two digit ($34$) is not divisible by four, and therefore, neither is the five-digit number. We also see that the sum of the five digits is $10$, and since $10$ is not divisible by three, neither is the five-digit number. However, notice that by increasing the five-digit number by two to form the number $10,236$, we create another even number and increase the digit-sum to $12$ (which takes care of the number being divisible by three). We have now eliminated the digit of four and added the digit of six, which is fine because $10,236$ being divisible by both two and three means that it is divisible by six. Our five-digit number is $\\boxed{10,\\!236}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Determine the smallest possible range for the five-digit integer.\nThe smallest possible range for the five-digit integer is 10,000 to 99,999.\nStep 2:  Start with the smallest possible five-digit integer, 10,000, and eliminate any numbers that do not meet the specified conditions.\nStep 3:  Move the 0 to the rightmost position and increment the leftmost digit. Check if the resulting five-digit integer has all different digits and is divisible by each of its non-zero digits.\nStep 4:  Continue this process of moving the 0 to the rightmost position and incrementing the leftmost digit until the conditions are met, or until all possibilities have been exhausted.\nStep 5:  Since the number must be divisible by its non-zero digits, the leftmost digit cannot be 0 or 1, so we will start with 2. The next smallest digit is 3, followed by 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Start with the smallest possible combination of the first four digits: 2345.\nStep 6:  Check if 12345 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, but any number is divisible by 1, so we only need to check divisibility by 2, 3, 4, and 5. 12345 is not divisible by 5, so we need to find a different number.\nStep 7:  Try 12346. Check if it is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\nStep 8:  Since 12346 is not divisible by 6, we need to find a different number. Let's try 12347. Check if it is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 7.\nStep 9:  Check if 12347 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 7.\nStep 10: \nCheck if 12347 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 7.",
