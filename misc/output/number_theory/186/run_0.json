    "problem": "Two brothers took $x$ cows to the market, and they sold each cow for $x$ dollars. After selling the cows, they divided the money by giving $\\$10$ to the older brother, $\\$10$ to the younger brother, $\\$10$ to the older, $\\$10$ to the younger, and so on. At the last division of money, the older brother received $\\$10$, but the younger brother received less than $\\$10$. How many dollars must the younger brother have received at the last division?",

    "solution": "Write $x$ in the form $10a + b$, where $b$ is the units digit of $x$ and $a$ is the \"remaining\" part of $x$.  (For example, if $x = 5718$, then $a = 571$ and $b = 8$.)  Then \\[x^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2.\\]Since the older brother was the last brother to receive a whole payment of $\\$10$, the tens digit of $x^2$ must be odd.  The tens digit of $100a^2$ is 0, and the tens digit of $20ab$ is even, so for the tens digit of \\[x^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2\\]to be odd, the tens digit of $b^2$ must be odd.\n\nWe know that $b$ is a digit from 0 to 9.  Checking these digits, we find that the tens digit of $b^2$ is odd only for $b = 4$ and $b = 6$.\n\nWe also see that the units digit of $x^2$ is the same as the units digit of $b^2$.  For both $b = 4$ and $b = 6$, the units digit of $b^2$ is 6.  Therefore, the last payment to the younger brother was $\\boxed{6}$ dollars.",
