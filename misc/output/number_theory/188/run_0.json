    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If a number $d$ divides into both $180$ and $168$, it must also divide into their difference. Thus, $d$ will be divisible by $180 - 168 = 12$. We notice that $12$ divides into both $180$ and $168$, so it follows that $\\boxed{12}$ must be the GCF of $180$ and $168$.",
