    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The largest power of $13$ which is smaller than $222$ is $13^2=169$. The largest multiple of $169$ less than $222$ is $1\\cdot 169$, and $222-1 \\cdot 169 = 53$. The largest power of $13$ which is smaller than $53$ is $13$, and the largest multiple of $13$ less than $53$ is $4\\cdot 13$. $53-4 \\cdot 13= 1$. Thus, $222=1 \\cdot 13^2 + 4 \\cdot 13^1 + 1 \\cdot 13^0$. So $222$ in base $13$ is $\\boxed{141_{13}}$.",
