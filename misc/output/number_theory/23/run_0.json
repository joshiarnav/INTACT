    "problem": "The length of the year on the planet Mars is exactly 697 days. If Mars has a calendar with a 12-day week, and year 0 begins on the first day of the week, what is the next year which will begin on the first day of the week?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since $697 = 12 \\cdot 58 + 1$, each Martian year consists of 58 weeks and a day.  Therefore, for every year that passes, the first day of the year shifts to the next day of the week.  Since year 0 begins on the first day, year 1 begins on the second day, then year 2 begins on the third day, and so on.  A week consists of 12 days, so the next year that begins on the first day again will be year $\\boxed{12}$.",
