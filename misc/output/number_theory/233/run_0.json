    "solution": "Since $5 \\times 24 = 120 = 121 - 1$, it follows that $-5 \\times 24 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{121}$. Adding 121 to $-5$ to make it positive, we find $(-5 + 121) \\times 24 \\equiv 116 \\times 24 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{121}$, so it follows that the modular inverse of $24$ is $\\boxed{116}$ when taken modulo $121$.",
