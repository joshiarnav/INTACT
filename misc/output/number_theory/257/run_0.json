    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The sum of the numbers from 1 to 100 is \\[1 + 2 + \\dots + 100 = \\frac{100 \\cdot 101}{2} = 5050.\\] When this number is divided by 77, the remainder is 45.  Therefore, the number that was removed must be congruent to 45 modulo 77.\n\nHowever, among the numbers 1, 2, $\\dots$, 100, only the number $\\boxed{45}$ itself is congruent to 45 modulo 77.  Therefore, this was the number of the card that was removed.",

Since 77(2) = 154 is the first multiple of 77 greater than 23, we must check if 77(2) - 35 = 83 is the missing number.\nStep 6: Check if 83 is a multiple of 77, which it is not; thus, 77k + 35 for some integer k must be the missing number.
