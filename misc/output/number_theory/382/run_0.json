    "problem": "What is the units digit of the product of the first 100 prime numbers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The product of the first 100 prime numbers includes the product $2\\times5=10$ since both 2 and 5 are prime. Since 0 multiplied by any number is 0, the units digit of the product of the first 100 prime numbers is $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "First step: List the first 100 prime numbers and identify their units digits.\nSecond step: Identify the units digits of the product of the first 100 prime numbers by looking for a pattern among the units digits of the primes.\nThird step: The product of the first 100 prime numbers has a units digit of 5, since the product of the first two prime numbers, 2 and 3, has a units digit of 6, and the product of 2 and 3 will be multiplied by 5 in the product of the first 4 prime numbers, which is 5, and the units digit of a number times 5 is always 0 or 5, but in this case the product of 2 and 3 and 5 is 30 and 30 times 5 is 150 and the units digit of 150 is 0, but the next prime is 7 and 0 times 7 is 0 and the units digit of 0 is 0.\nFourth step: Since the product of the first 100 prime numbers ends in 0, it is divisible by 10, and therefore its units digit is 0.\nFifth step: Therefore, the units digit of the product of the first 100 prime numbers is 0.\nSixth step: Final Answer: The final answer is 0.",
