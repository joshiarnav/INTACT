    "problem": "Arnold must water his cactus plants every 9 days and he must feed them every 60 days. He watered and fed them last Tuesday. What day of the week will it be the next time he waters and feeds them on the same day?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The next time he feeds and waters them on the same day is after $\\text{lcm}(9,60)=180$ days.  Now to determine the day of the week we compute  \\[180\\equiv5\\pmod7.\\] This day falls 5 days later in the week than a Tuesday, so he next feeds them on the same day on a $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "A number that is a multiple of 9 and a multiple of 60 is a multiple of their lowest common multiple, which is 180.\nTo find the next time he waters and feeds them on the same day, we need to find the next multiple of 180 after Tuesday.\nThe next Tuesday after this Tuesday is 7 days later. To find the next multiple of 180 after Tuesday, we can add 7 to the current day (Tuesday) to get Thursday.\nAdd 180 to 7 to get the number of days until the next time he waters and feeds them on the same day, and convert this number of days to days of the week.\n179 + 7 = 186\n186 days is equivalent to 26 weeks and 2 days.\nConvert 26 weeks and 2 days to days of the week by adding 2 days to the next Tuesday after the current Tuesday.\nSince 26 weeks is a multiple of 7 days, it is equivalent to 0 weeks. Adding 2 days to the next Tuesday after the current Tuesday gives us Thursday.\nSince 26 weeks is a multiple of 7 days, it is equivalent to 0 weeks. Adding 2 days to the next Tuesday after the current Tuesday gives us Thursday.",
