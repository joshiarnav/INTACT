    "solution": "We look at all the possible three-digit perfect squares: 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961. We can find a list with three such perfect squares: 169, 196, 961. However, we can't find such a list with four squares. Therefore, the maximum possible length of such a list is $\\boxed{3}$.",
