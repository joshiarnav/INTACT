    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We start by computing the sum of the units digits of all multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $30$. Excluding $0$, every possible digit appears exactly once as a unit digit of a multiple of $3$: the set of multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $30$ consists of the numbers $0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30$. Thus, the sum of their units digits is equal to $$1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2} = 45.$$ We must sum the units digits of the multiples of $3$ between $31$ and $50$. The relevant multiples of $3$ are  $33,36,39,42,45,48$, and the sum of their units digits is $3+6+9+2+5+8 = 33$. Thus, the answer is $45 + 33 = \\boxed{78}$.",
