    "problem": "On a particular map, $3$ inches on the map equates to $10$ miles in real life. If you know that the real life distance between two buildings on the map is $53.25$ miles, what would the distance between the buildings be (in inches) on the map, expressed as a fraction?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If we let the distance between the buildings on the map be $d$, then $\\frac{d}{53.25} = \\frac{3}{10}$. Cross-multiplying and solving for $d$, we obtain $10d = 159.75 \\Rightarrow d=15.975$ inches. Expressed as a fraction, $d = 15\\frac{975}{1000} = \\boxed{15\\frac{39}{40}},$ or $\\boxed{\\frac{639}{40}}$ inches.",
