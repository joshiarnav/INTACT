    "solution": "First we find the number of $4$ digit palindromes. There are ten palindromes for every distinct thousandth digit from $1$ to $9$ because there are $10$ numbers from $0$ to $9$ we could pick for the second and third digit. This gives us a total of $9 \\cdot 10$ palindromes.\n\nNext, we can get that all palindromes are multiples of $11$. The divisibility rule for $11$ tells us that for a number $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$. Since $a=d$ and $b=c$, $a-b+c-d$ is always divisible by $11$ so all four digit palindromes are divisible by $11$.\n\nNow we want to find now many of these palindromes are divisible by $9$. For a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9.$ It's impossible for the sum of the digits to be equal to $9$ or $27$ because it must be an even number (the sum is $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)$). We find the number of palindromes whose digits add up to $18.$ Since $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)=18,$ we get that $a+b=9.$ There are $9$ possible answers, where $a$ goes from $1$ to $9$ and $b=9-a$. We then find the number of palindromes whose digit add up to $36.$ There is only one four-digit number that does so, $9999.$\n\nTherefore, we have that there are $9+1=10$ four-digit palindromes that are divisible by $99.$\n\nSince there is a total of $90$ palindromes, the probability that it is divisible by $99$ is $\\frac{10}{90}=\\boxed{\\frac19}$.",

This occurs when $A+B=B+A=9,$ which simplifies to $2A=9.$ Therefore, $A=4.5,$ but since A must be a digit, there are no solutions for A. So, 0 four-digit palindromes are multiples of 9.\nStep 5:\nSince every multiple of $99$ is also a multiple of $9$ and $11,$ we need to find the number of four-digit palindromes that are multiples of $9$ and $11.$\nSince there are no solutions for multiples of 9, we need to find the number of four-digit palindromes that are multiples of $11.$\nFor a four-digit palindrome $ABBA,$ to be a multiple of $11,$ we must have $2A-B=0,$ or equivalently, $B=2A.$\nSince $A$ cannot be 0 and less than 5, we can have $A=2, 3, 4,$ giving us 3 possibilities.\nWhen $A=2,$ we have $B=4,$ so one number is a multiple of $11.$\nWhen $A=3,$ we have $B=6,$ so another number is a multiple of $11.$\nWhen $A=4,$ we have $B=8,$ so another number is a multiple of $11.$\nHence, there are 3 four-digit palindromes that are multiples of $11.$\nStep 6:\nTo find the probability that a four-digit palindrome is a multiple of $99,$ we need to find the ratio of the number of palindromes that are multiples of $99$ to the total number of four-digit palindromes.\nStep 7:  The probability that a four-digit palindrome is a multiple of $99$ is $\\frac{0}{90}.$\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
