    "model_solution": "Step 1:  To find the ones digit of $35^{12}$, we need to first determine the pattern of the ones digits of powers of 5, as 35 ends in 5.\nStep 2:  We note that the ones digit of $5^1$ is 5, the ones digit of $5^2$ is 25, the ones digit of $5^3$ is 125, and the ones digit of $5^4$ is 625. Therefore, the ones digit of $5^4$ is 5.\nStep 2:  Since the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we need to find the remainder when 12 is divided by 4. The remainder is 0, so the ones digit of $35^{12}$ is the same as the ones digit of $35^4$.\nStep 2:  Since $35^4 = (5 \\cdot 7)^4 = 5^4 \\cdot 7^4$, the ones digit of $35^4$ is the same as the ones digit of $5^4$, which is 5.\nStep 3:  Since the ones digit of $35^4$ is 5, the ones digit of $35^{12}$ is 5.\nStep 4: The ones digit of $35^{12}$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\nStep 2: Since $35^4 = (5 \\cdot 7)^4 = 5^4 \\cdot 7^4$, the ones digit of $35^4$ is the same as the ones digit of $5^4$, which is 5.\nSince the ones digit of $35^4$ is 5, \nthe ones digit of $35^{12}$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\nSince $35^4 = (5 \\cdot 7)^4 = 5^4 \\cdot 7^4$, the ones digit of $35^4$ is the same as the ones digit of $5^4$, which is 5.\nSince the ones digit of $35^4$ is 5, the ones digit of $35^{12}$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
