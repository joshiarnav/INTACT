    "problem": "February $1$, $2008$ is a Friday.  The last Friday of February $2008$ will be February $x$, $2008$.  If $2008$ is a leap year, what is the value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If 2008 is a leap year, that means there are 29 days in February, and February 29 is $28=7\\cdot4$ days after February 1, so it is also a Friday. Thus, $x=\\boxed{29}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Determine the number of days in February $2008$ and the position of the days of the week in the calendar for that year.\nStep 2:  February 2008 has 29 days, and since it's a leap year, and we know that February 1, 2008 is a Friday, we can count forward 28 days to determine the day of the week: $\\text{Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday}.$\nStep 2:  The first 28 days of February 2008 fall on the days of the week in the sequence $\\text{Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday}.$ Since a week has 7 days, we can divide 28 by 7 to get 4 with a remainder of 0. The remainder 0 means that every 7 days, the day of the week repeats. Therefore, February 1 is a Friday, February 8 is a Friday, February 15 is a Friday, and February 22 is a Friday.\nStep 3:  Since the last Friday of February 2008 is the 22nd, then $x=22$.\nStep 4: Final Answer",
