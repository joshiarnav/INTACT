    "problem": "Zach has three bags and a bunch of pencils to be placed into the bags. He is told to place the greatest number of pencils possible into each of the three bags while also keeping the number of pencils in each bag the same. What is the greatest number of pencils he could have left over?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If Zach has three or more pencils left over, then he can add another pencil to each bag.  Therefore, Zach can have at most $\\boxed{2}$ pencils left over.",

    "model_solution": "Let's start solving the problem:\n\nTo find the greatest number of pencils Zach could have left over, we need to find the greatest number of pencils that is 1 more than a multiple of 3.\n\nAssume Zach has x pencils, he can put x/3 pencils in each bag, with no remainder. But he can put 1 more pencil into one of the bags to leave the maximum number of pencils.\nZach can put x/3 pencils in each bag, with no remainder. This means x must be a multiple of 3. Let's say x = 3n, where n is an integer. Then, n pencils will be left over.\nSince x = 3n represents all possible numbers of pencils that can be evenly distributed into 3 bags, we need to consider the next multiple of 3 that is greater than x.\nIf Zach puts 1 more pencil in one of the bags, the number of pencils he has left over is (n + 1) - n = 1.\nIf Zach puts 1 more pencil in one of the bags, the total number of pencils becomes 3n + 1, which could also be a possible value for x. But since we are looking for the greatest number of pencils that is 1 more than a multiple of 3, x must be the largest possible value that is 1 more than a multiple of 3 and less than 3(n+1).\nThe greatest number of pencils Zach could have left over is 1 more than the greatest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 3n, which is (3n - 3) + 1 = 3n - 2.\nSince x = 3n represents all possible numbers of pencils that can be evenly distributed into 3 bags, we need to consider the next multiple of 3 that is greater than x.\nThe next multiple of 3 that is greater than x is 3(n + 1) = 3n + 3.\nThe greatest number of pencils Zach could have left over is 3n - 2, but this is less than 1. Therefore, Zach must have at least 4 pencils, which is a multiple of 1 but not 3.\nThe next multiple of 3 that is greater than x is 3(n + 1) = 3n + 3.\nThe greatest number of pencils Zach could have left over is 2n - 1 = 2(n - 1) + 1 = 2(3n/3 - 1) + 1 = 2(3n/3 - 1) + 1.",
