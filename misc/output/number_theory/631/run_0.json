    "problem": "One gear turns $33\\frac{1}{3}$ times in a minute.  Another gear turns   45 times in a minute.  Initially, a mark on each gear is pointing  due north.  After how many seconds will the two gears next  have both their marks pointing due north?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "One gear turns $33\\frac{1}{3}=100/3$ times in 60 seconds, so it turns 5/9 times in one second, or 5 times in 9 seconds. The other gear turns 45 times in 60 seconds, so it turns 3/4 times in one second, or 3 times in 4 seconds. To find out after how many seconds the two gears next have both their marks pointing due north, we have to find the least common multiple of $4=2^2$ and $9=3^2$, which is $2^2\\cdot3^2=36$. Therefore, the two gears next have both their marks pointing due north after $\\boxed{36}$ seconds. (One gear turns exactly $5\\times4=20$ times, and the other gear turns exactly $3\\times9=27$ times.)",

The first gear turns $33\\frac{1}{3}=100/3$ times in a minute and the second gear turns 45 times in a minute.\nStep 2: The LCM of 100 and 45 is 900.\nStep 3: To find the time it takes for both gears to turn so that the marks are pointing due north again, we need to find the time it takes for the first gear to turn 900/100=9 times and the second gear to turn 900/45=20 times.\nStep 4: The first gear turns 9 times in 9 minutes, and 9 minutes is equal to 9 x 60 = 540 seconds. The second gear turns 20 times in 20 minutes, and 20 minutes is equal to 20 x 60 = 1200 seconds.\nStep 5: We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 540 and 1200 seconds.\nStep 6: The LCM of 540 and 1200 is 3600 seconds.\nThe time it takes for both gears to turn so that the marks are pointing due north again is 3600 seconds.\nStep 7: The LCM of 540 and 1200 is 3600 seconds.\nStep 7: The least common multiple (LCM) of 540 and 1200 is indeed 3600 seconds.\nStep 8: The time it takes for both gears to turn so that the marks are pointing due north again is 3600 seconds.",
