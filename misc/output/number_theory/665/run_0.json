    "problem": "How many positive perfect cube factors does $3^65^{10}$ have?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Any factor of $3^6\\cdot5^{10}$ is in the form $3^a\\cdot5^b$ for $0\\le a\\le6$ and $0\\le b\\le{10}$. To count the number of perfect cube factors, we must count the factors of $3^6\\cdot5^{10}$ that have $a=0$, $3$, or $6$ and $b=0$, $3$, $6$, or $9$. This gives $3\\cdot4=\\boxed{12}$ perfect cube factors.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Factor the expression $3^6 5^{10}$ into its prime factors.\nStep 2: Determine the possible exponents of the prime factorization of a positive perfect cube that divides $3^6 5^{10}$\nStep 3: For each prime factor, determine the number of perfect cube factors that can be formed.\nThe exponents of the prime factorization of $3^6 5^{10}$ are $6$ and $10$, respectively. So, there are $2$ perfect cube factors that can be formed from the prime factorization of $3^6$, namely $3^0,3^3$ and there are $2$ perfect cube factors that can be formed from the prime factorization of $5^{10}$, namely $5^0,5^5$.\n\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 4. I hope it is correct.",
