    "solution": "Let $\\, 2^{e_1} 3^{e_2} 5^{e_3} \\cdots \\,$ be the prime factorization of $\\, n$.  Then the  number of positive divisors of $\\, n \\,$ is $\\, (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)(e_3 + 1) \\cdots \\; $. In view of the given information, we have \\[\n28 = (e_1 + 2)(e_2 + 1)P\n\\]and \\[\n30 = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 2)P,\n\\]where $\\, P = (e_3 + 1)(e_4 + 1) \\cdots \\; $. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we obtain $\\, 2 = (e_1 - e_2)P,\n\\,$ so either $\\, e_1 - e_2 = 1 \\,$ and $\\, P = 2, \\,$ or $\\, e_1\n- e_2 = 2 \\,$ and $\\, P = 1$.  The first case yields $\\, 14 = (e_1\n+ 2)e_1 \\,$ and  $\\, (e_1 + 1)^2 = 15$; since $\\, e_1 \\,$ is a nonnegative integer, this is impossible. In the second case, $\\,\ne_2 = e_1 - 2 \\,$ and $\\, 30 = (e_1 + 1)e_1, \\,$ from which we find $\\, e_1 = 5 \\,$ and $\\, e_2 = 3$.  Thus $\\, n = 2^5 3^3, \\,$ so $\\, 6n = 2^6 3^4 \\,$ has $\\, (6+1)(4+1) = \\boxed{35} \\,$ positive divisors.",
