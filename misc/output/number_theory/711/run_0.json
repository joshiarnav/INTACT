    "problem": "The greatest common divisor of positive integers $m$ and $n$ is 8. The least common multiple of $m$ and $n$ is 112. What is the least possible value of $m+n$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since the GCD of $m$ and $n$ is 8, $m = 8x$ and $n = 8y$ for some integers $x$ and $y$.  Note that minimizing $m + n = 8x + 8y = 8(x + y)$ is equivalent to minimizing $x + y$.\n\nThe LCM of $m$ and $n$ is $112 = 2^4 \\cdot 7 = 8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7$, so one of $x$ and $y$ is divisible by 2 and one is divisible by 7.  Then we can minimize $x + y$ by setting $x$ and $y$ to be 2 and 7 in some order.  Therefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is $8(2 + 7) = \\boxed{72}$.",

The only pairs of positive integers $(a,b)$ that satisfy $ab=14$ and have a greatest common divisor of 1 are $(14,1)$ and $(7,2).$\nStep 5:  If $a=14$ and $b=1,$ then $m=8a=8\\cdot 14=112$ and $n=8b=8\\cdot 1=8.$ If $a=7$ and $b=2,$ then $m=8a=8\\cdot 7=56$ and $n=8b=8\\cdot 2=16.$ The sum of these two pairs of values is $m+n=112+8=120$ and $m+n=56+16=72.$\nStep 6:\nThe smallest possible value of $m+n$ is 72.\nThe final step is not required for this problem.\nStep 7:  Since $m=8a$ and $n=8b,$ then $m+n=8a+8b=8(a+b).$\nStep 8:  From the previous steps, we have two possible pairs for $(m,n)$: $(112,8)$ and $(56,16)$.
