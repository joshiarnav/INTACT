    "problem": "What is the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is $12$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "To get the largest number, first maximize the hundreds digit, then the tens, then the ones. One-digit factors of $12$ are $6$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $1$, so the hundreds digit must be $6$.  In order to make the digits multiply to 12, the next two digits must be $2$ and $1$.  Therefore, the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is $12$ is $\\boxed{621}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: To find the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is 12, list all the three-digit numbers whose digits multiply to 12: 112, 116, 132, 136, 144, 156, 216, 236, 264, 312, 316, 324, 336, 384, 412, 416, 432, 456, 612, 624, 636, 714, 816, 912, 936.\nStep 2: Since the product of the digits is $12$, we know that the digits must be among $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $6$. We want to maximize the number, so we want to put the largest digit we can in the leftmost position. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{964}$",
