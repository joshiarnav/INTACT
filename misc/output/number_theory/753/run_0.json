    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "An integer is divisible by $18$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$ and the last digit is even (meaning it is divisible by both 9 and 2).  The sum of the digits of $-11213141$ is 14.  Since $-11213141$ is negative, this number is 5 $\\textit{less than}$ a multiple of 9.  The number is 4 $\\textit{more than}$ a multiple of 9.  Subtracting 4 gives  \\[-11213141 = -11213145+4.\\]Since $-11213145$ has a digit sum of 18, this number is a multiple of 9.  However this is not a multiple of 18 so we need to subtract 9 again: \\[-11213141 = -11213154+13.\\]Now the number $-11213154$ is a multiple of 18, so the answer is $\\boxed{13}$. $$-11213141\\equiv 13\\pmod {18}.$$",
