    "problem": "What is the largest perfect square less than 225 that is a multiple of 9?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "In order for a number to be a multiple of 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since $225=15^2$, the largest perfect square that is less than 225 is $14^2=196$. However, $1+9+6=16$, which is not divisible by 9. The next largest perfect square less than 225 is $13^2=169$, but again, $1+6+9$ is not divisible by 9. Continuing,  $12^2=144$. The sum of the digits of $144$ is $1+4+4=9$, so $\\boxed{144}$ is the largest perfect square less than 225 that is a multiple of 9.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: List all of the multiples of 9 that are less than 225.\nStep 2: Identify the perfect squares among the listed multiples of 9.\nStep 3: Determine the largest perfect square from the identified perfect squares that is less than 225.\nStep 4: Since 225 is not a perfect square, identify the perfect squares that are multiples of 9 by squaring the multiples of 3: 9^2 = 81, 15^2 = 225, so the largest perfect square that is a multiple of 9 and less than 225 is 18^2 = 324. However, 324 is greater than 225, so we look at the next lower multiple of 9, which is 18 - 3 = 15. The largest perfect square that is a multiple of 9 and less than 225 is 15^2 = 225, which is not a solution. Therefore, we look at the next lower multiple of 9, which is 18 - 6 = 12. The largest perfect square that is a multiple of 9 and less than 225 is 12^2 = 144.\nThe final answer is: 144.",
