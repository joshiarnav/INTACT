    "problem": "What is the greatest odd integer that is a factor of $5!$ ?  (Reminder: For a positive integer $n$, the expression $n!$ stands for the product of the integers from 1 up to (and including) $n$.)",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since a product of odd integers is odd, we can find the largest odd factor of an integer by removing the factors of 2 from its prime factorization. Since the only odd prime factors of 5! are 5 and 3, the greatest odd divisor of 5! is $5 \\times 3 = \\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Write the expression for 5! as a product of its prime factors.\nStep 2: Identify the prime factors that are odd and determine their product.\nStep 3: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1, the odd prime factors are 3 and 5. Their product is 3 * 5 = 15.\nStep 4: The greatest odd factor of 5! is 15.\nStep 5: The greatest odd factor of 5! is 15.\nThe final answer is: The greatest odd factor of 5! is 15.",
