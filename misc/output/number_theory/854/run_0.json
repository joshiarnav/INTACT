    "solution": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.  Therefore, the smallest positive integer with 12 factors must be in the list $2^{11}=2048$, $2^5\\cdot3=96$, ${2^3\\cdot3^2}=72$, and $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$.  The smallest of these is $\\boxed{60}$.",

The product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^6$, so the product of the divisors of $n^6$ is $(n^6)^{\\frac{49}{2}}=n^{147}$. Therefore, $n^{147}=n^6$, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is $n=2$.\nStep 3:\nThe number $2$ is a square root of $n^{147}$, so the prime factorization of $2$ is the prime factorization of $n^{147}$.
