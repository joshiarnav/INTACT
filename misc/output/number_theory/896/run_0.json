    "solution": "Note the prime factorizations $700=2^2\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7$ and $7000=2^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7$.\n\nIf $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r,700]=7000$, then in particular, $r$ is a divisor of $7000$, so we can write $r=2^\\alpha\\cdot 5^\\beta\\cdot 7^\\gamma$, where $0\\le\\alpha\\le 3$, $0\\le\\beta\\le 3$, and $0\\le\\gamma\\le 1$.\n\nMoreover, we know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r,700]=2^{\\max\\{\\alpha,2\\}}\\cdot 5^{\\max\\{\\beta,2\\}}\\cdot 7^{\\max\\{\\gamma,1\\}}$, and we know that this is equal to $7000=2^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7$. This is possible only if $\\alpha=3$ and $\\beta=3$, but $\\gamma$ can be $0$ or $1$, giving us two choices for $r$: $$r = 2^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7^0 = 1000 \\text{~~or~~} r=2^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7^1 = 7000.$$So the sum of all solutions is $1000+7000=\\boxed{8000}$.",
