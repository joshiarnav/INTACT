    "problem": "The ones digit of the product of four consecutive positive integers is 4. If this product is greater than 1000, what is the sum of the four smallest such integers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Note that exactly two of every four consecutive integers are divisible by 2. Therefore, since the ones digit of the product of four consecutive positive integers is 4, none of the integers is divisible by 5 (else the product $2\\times5$ would make the units digit 0). Thus, the four consecutive integers can only have ones digits 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively, or 6, 7, 8, 9 respectively. Indeed, the units digit of both $1\\times2\\times3\\times4=24$ and $6\\times7\\times8\\times9=3024$ is 4. We wish to minimize the four integers given that their product is greater than 1000, so we take the bigger ones digits (to have smaller tens digits). $6\\times7\\times8\\times9>1000$, so we are done. The desired sum is $6+7+8+9=\\boxed{30}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Let the four consecutive integers be n, n+1, n+2, and n+3, and let's consider the product of these integers and see how its last digit relates to n.\nStep 2:  We can write the product of the four consecutive integers as n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3), and since we want the ones digit of this product to be 4, we can analyze the possible values of n that satisfy this condition.\nStep 3:\nThe ones digit of the product of four consecutive positive integers is 4, which means the product ends in 4. The only way for a product to end in 4 is to have a factor of 4. Since the product of four consecutive integers is $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$, we can check the possible values of $n$ that make the product end in 4.\nThe product of four consecutive integers $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$ is divisible by 4 if $n$ is even. If $n$ is even, then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$ is divisible by 4 and, if $n$ is even and greater than or equal to 4, then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$ is divisible by $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$. We can continue to consider the divisibility by 6, 8, 9, etc., but we need to check the divisibility by 5 as well because 1000 is divisible by 5.\nStep 4:  To determine the possible values of n that satisfy the given conditions, we need to check the divisibility of the product by 5, in addition to the other factors. This will help us narrow down the range of values for n that make the product greater than 1000 and have a ones digit of 4.\nStep 5: \nLet's analyze the divisibility by 5. Since 1000 ends in 0, and we're looking for the product to be greater than 1000, we can check if the product is divisible by 5. We know that the last digit of the product of four consecutive integers is 4, which is not divisible by 5. However, we can check the divisibility by 5 in the following way: check if any of n, n+1, n+2, or n+3 is divisible by 5.\nStep 6: \nIf n is divisible by 5, then n = 5k for some integer k. If n + 3 is divisible by 5, then n + 3 = 5l for some integer l. We can check these two cases separately to determine the possible values of n that satisfy the given conditions.\nStep 7:\nIf n is divisible by 5, then n = 5k for some integer k. Then the product of four consecutive integers is $5k(5k+1)(5k+2)(5k+3) = 5^4\\cdot k(k+1)(k+2)(k+3)$, which is divisible by $5^4=625$. This means that the product is at least $5^4\\cdot 5\\cdot 6\\cdot 7 = 31,125$, which is greater than 1000. Since we need the product to be greater than 1000, we can check the values of n = 5k for k = 2, 3, 4, etc. to find the four smallest such integers.\nStep 8:\nFor n = 10, the product is 10(11)(12)(13) = 17160 which is greater than 1000 and the last digit is 0, not 4. For n = 15, the product is 15(16)(17)(18) = 48960 which is greater than 1000 and the last digit is 0, not 4. For n = 20, the product is 20(21)(22)(23) = 106880 which is greater than 1000 and the last digit is 0, not 4. For n = 25, the product is 25(26)(27)(28) = 145800 which is greater than 1000 and the last digit is 0, not 4. For n = 30, the product is 30(31)(32)(33) = 189240 which is greater than 1000 and the last digit is 0, not 4. For n = 35, the product is 35(36)(37)(38) = 252240 which is greater than 1000 and the last digit is 0, not 4.\nStep 9:\nIf n+3 is divisible by 5, then n+3 = 5l for some integer l. Then the product of four consecutive integers is $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) = (n+3-3)(n+3-2)(n+3-1)(n+3) = (5l-3)(5l-2)(5l-1)(5l)$, which is divisible by $5^4=625$. This means that the product is at least $5^4\\cdot 5\\cdot 6\\cdot 7 = 31,125$, which is greater than 1000. Since we need the product to be greater than 1000, we can check the values of n+3 = 5l for l = 2, 3, 4, etc. to find the four smallest such integers.",
