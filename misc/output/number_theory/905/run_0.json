    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The integers from 1 to 100 that leave a remainder of 1 are 1, 6, 11, $\\dots$, 96.  If we subtract 1 from each of these numbers, we get 0, 5, 10, $\\dots$, 95.  If we divide each of these numbers by 5, then we get 0, 1, 2, $\\dots$, 19.  Finally, if we add 1 to each of these numbers, then we get 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, 20.  Therefore, the number of terms in 1, 6, 11, $\\dots$, 96 is the same as the number of terms in 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, 20, which is $\\boxed{20}$.  (This number is the same as the percentage since we are dealing with 100 numbers.)",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  To find the percent of the integers from 1 to 100, inclusive, that leave remainder 1 when divided by 5, we can start by identifying the pattern of numbers that satisfy this condition.\n1. Determine the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 in the range from 1 to 100. These numbers have the form 5m + 1, where m is an integer.\n2. Count the total number of integers from 1 to 100 and determine the count of numbers that satisfy the condition of leaving a remainder of 1 when divided by 5.\nStep 2: \nThe numbers that satisfy this condition are in the form of 5m + 1, with m being an integer from 0 to 19, as we need to find numbers between 1 and 100. Therefore, we can count the numbers in this sequence: 1, 6, 11, \u2026, 96. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 5.\nStep 3: To count the total number of integers from 1 to 100 that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, we need to determine the number of terms in the arithmetic sequence 1, 6, 11, \u2026, 96. The number of terms, n, can be calculated using the formula n = (l - a)/d + 1, where l is the last term, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\nStep 4: \n Plug the values into the formula to find the number of terms: l = 96, a = 1, and d = 5. Then, substitute these values into n = (l - a)/d + 1.\nStep 5: \nn = (96 - 1)/5 + 1 = 95/5 + 1 = 19 + 1 = 20\nStep 6: \nTo calculate the percent, we will use the formula: (number of integers that satisfy the condition / total number of integers) * 100. The number of integers that satisfy the condition is 20 (calculated in Step 5), and the total number of integers is 100.\nStep 7: \n(20/100) * 100 = 20%\nStep 8: \n(20/100) * 100 = 20%\nStep 3: To count the total number of integers from 1 to 100 that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, we need to determine the number of terms in the arithmetic sequence 1, 6, 11, \u2026, 96.
