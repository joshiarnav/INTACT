    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For integer $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ must be divisible by $11$. The only possibilities for $a-b+c-d$ are $-11$, $0$, and $11$.\nPossibility 1: $1-b+c-4=-11 \\implies c-b=-8$. This gives us two possible values: $c=0, b=8$, and $c=1, b=9$.\nPossibility 2: $1-b+c-4=0 \\implies c-b=3$. This gives us $7$ possible values, where $c$ is any integer from $3$ to $9$, and $b=c-3$.\nPossibility 3: $1-b+c-4=11 \\implies c-b=14$. This is impossible since the digit $c$ cannot be greater than $14$,  Thus there are a total of $2+7=\\boxed{9}$ possible values.",
