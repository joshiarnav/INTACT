    "problem": "Let an integer $x$ be bad if there is no way to insert a colon among the digits of $x$ to form a time of day (on a twelve-hour, digital clock), and good if a colon can be inserted to form a time. For example, 100 is good because we can write 1:00, but 164 is bad. How many bad integers between 100 and 200 are equivalent to 3 mod 4?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "A way of obtaining all good integers is by analyzing all possible times and removing the colon. Therefore, we get that the integers between 100 and 159 are good, along with the integer 200. Therefore, the integers between 160 and 199 are all bad. Since we can write an integer equivalent to 3 mod 4 in the from $4k+3$, we have to solve the inequalities $4k+3 \\ge 160$ and $4k+3 \\le 199$. The first inequality has solution $k \\ge \\frac{157}{4}$, and the second inequality has solution $k \\le 49$. Since $k$ must be an integer, $k$ is between 40 and 49. There are $\\boxed{10}$ such integers.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Let's start by considering the possible forms of a bad integer between 100 and 200 that is equivalent to $3 \\pmod 4$. We observe that any such integer must be of the form $4k+3$ for some integer $k$, and its digits can be expressed as $ab3$.\nThe two possible cases for the integer are:\nCase 1: $a=b$, and $a \\neq 2$\nIn this case, we have a number of the form $aba3$. We can form a time by inserting a colon after $ab$, resulting in $ab:03$, which is a valid time.\nStep 2: \nCase 2: $a\\neq b$, and $a=1$, $b=0$\nIn this case, the number is 103. We can insert a colon after the first digit, resulting in 10:3, which is not a valid time.\nStep 3:  Since we have covered the cases where the first two digits are the same or the first digit is 1 and the second digit is 0, we now consider the case where the first digit is 1 and the second digit is not 0.\nStep 4:  For the case where the first digit is 1 and the second digit is not 0, we need to consider the possibilities for the second digit, which can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. We also need to consider the possibilities for the third digit, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. The third digit can be any of these values because there's no restriction on it.\nStep 5:  We need to count the number of integers between 100 and 200 that are equivalent to 3 mod 4 and are of the form 1x3. There are 10 possibilities for the second digit, and for each of these, there are 10 possibilities for the third digit. Therefore, the total number of bad integers is $10*10=100$.\nStep 4: There are 10 possibilities for the second digit and 10 possibilities for the third digit, so there are $10 \\times 10 = 100$ bad integers of the form 1x3.\nStep 5: There are 10 possibilities for the second digit and 10 possibilities for the third digit, so there are 10 bad integers of the form 2x3.\nStep 6: The number of bad integers of the form 1x3 is 100, and the number of bad integers of the form 2x3 is 10. Therefore, the total number of bad integers between 100 and 200 that are equivalent to $3 \\pmod 4$ is $100 + 10 = 110$.\nStep 7: $110$\nStep 8: \nThe number of bad integers of the form 1x3 is 100, and the number of bad integers of the form 2x3 is 10. Therefore, the total number of bad integers between 100 and 200 that are equivalent to $3 \\pmod 4$ is $100 + 10 = 110$.",
