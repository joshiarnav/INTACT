    "problem": "What is the largest number $k$ less than 1000 such that the remainder is 1 when $k$ is divided by each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We can re-write the requirements of this problem as: \\begin{align*}k &\\equiv1\\pmod{3}\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{4},\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{5},\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{6},\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{7}.\n\\end{align*}In other words, $k-1$ is divisible by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. We have  \\begin{align*}\n\\text{lcm}[3,4,5,6,7] &= \\text{lcm}[3,4,5,7] \\\\\n&= 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 \\\\&= 420,\n\\end{align*}and thus $k-1$ must be divisible by $420$. The only two multiples of $420$ under $1000$ are $420$ and $840$, so the largest possible value of $k$ is $840+1 = \\boxed{841}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  To find the largest number $k$ that satisfies the given conditions, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which are the divisors involved.\nStep 2:  The LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is $2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 420.$\nStep 2:  We are looking for the largest number less than 1000 that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. This means that when $k$ is divided by each of these numbers, the remainder is 1. So, we can express $k$ as $k = 420q + 1$, where $q$ is an integer representing the quotient when $k$ is divided by the LCM of the divisors. Our goal is to find the largest value of $q$ such that $k$ is less than 1000.\nStep 3:  We need to find the largest integer $q$ such that $k = 420q + 1$ is less than 1000.\nStep 2:  To find the largest number less than 1000 that satisfies the given conditions, we need to determine the largest possible value of $q$ such that $420q + 1$ is less than 1000.\nStep 3:  We set up the inequality $420q + 1 < 1000$ and solve for $q$.\nStep 4: $420q + 1 < 1000 \\Rightarrow 420q < 999 \\Rightarrow q < \\frac{999}{420} \\approx 2.38$. Since $q$ must be an integer, the largest possible value of $q$ is $2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{841}$",
