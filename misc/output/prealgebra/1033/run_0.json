    "problem": "If a 12-hour analog clock reads 8:00, what is the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the minute and hour hands?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The hour hand is at $8$ and the minute hand is at $12$, which span 4 hours.  Each hour on the 12-hour analog clock spans $360/12=30$ degrees, so the angle formed here is $30\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{120}$ degrees.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: At 8:00, the minute hand is pointing at the 12 and the hour hand is pointing at the 8.\nStep 2: Each number on the clock represents 30 degrees, so the hour hand is 8 \u00d7 30 = 240 degrees from the 12.\nStep 3: The smaller angle formed by the minute and hour hands is the difference between 360 and the angle of the hour hand, so it is 360 - 240 = 120 degrees.\nStep 4: At 8:00, the minute hand has moved to the 12, which is 0 degrees from the 12.\nStep 5: The difference between the positions of the minute and hour hands is 0 - 240 = -240 degrees.\nStep 6: Since an angle cannot be negative, take the absolute value of -240 to get 240 degrees.\nStep 7: However, the angle between the two hands is smaller; it is the difference between 360 and the absolute value of -240.\nStep 8: 360 - 240 = 120 degrees.\nStep 9: The minute and hour hands are on opposite sides of the clock, so the smaller angle formed by the minute and hour hands is 360 - 240 = 120 degrees.\nStep 10: The smaller angle formed by the minute and hour hands is 120 degrees.",
