    "problem": "A figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Each full circle is 360 degrees.  Dividing 360 into 2250 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 90.  So, she spins 90 degrees to her right past north, which leaves her facing $\\boxed{\\text{east}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Convert the total angle spun from degrees to a more useful measure for determining direction, such as a fraction of a full rotation (360\u00b0).\nStep 2: Divide the total angle spun by the number of degrees in a full rotation (360\u00b0) to find the fraction of a full rotation spun. 2250\u00b0 \u00f7 360\u00b0 = 6.25\nStep 3: Multiply the fraction of a full rotation spun (6.25) by the number of full rotations in a 360\u00b0 circle to determine the total number of full rotations and the remaining angle. Since 6 rotations equal 2160\u00b0, the remaining angle is 2250\u00b0 - 2160\u00b0 = 90\u00b0.\nStep 4: Since the remaining angle (90\u00b0) is less than 180\u00b0, the figure skater will be facing in the opposite direction of where she started.\nStep 5: Since the figure skater initially spun to her right and the remaining angle is 90\u00b0, she will end up facing south.\nStep 6: Since the figure skater initially faced north and spun to her right, and the remaining angle (90\u00b0) is less than 180\u00b0, she will be facing south.\nStep 7: The figure skater initially faced north and spun 90 degrees to the right, so she will be facing south.\nStep 5: Since the figure skater initially spun to her right and the remaining angle is 90\u00b0, she will end up facing south.",
