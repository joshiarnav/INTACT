    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of the old square is $2\\cdot2=4$ square inches. The new area is $4+21=25$ square inches. So each side of the new square measures $\\sqrt{25}=\\boxed{5}$ inches.",

    "model_solution": "First step: Let x be the length of a side of the new square.\nThe area of the new square is $x^2$, and the area of the original square is $2^2=4$, so we have the equation $x^2=4+21$.\nSecond step: Solve the equation $x^2 = 25$ to get $x = \\sqrt{25}$.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
