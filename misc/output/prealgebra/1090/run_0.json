    "problem": "The ratio of losses to wins for Kyle's team is 3 to 2. If the team had played the same number of games, but had won twice as many of its games, what would the ratio of losses to wins have been? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of losses for Kyle's team be $3x$. Thus, the number of wins for Kyle's team is $2x$. If the team had played the same number of games ($5x$) but won twice as many of its games, the team would have won $4x$ games and lost the remaining $5x-4x=x$ games. The ratio of losses to wins would then be $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
