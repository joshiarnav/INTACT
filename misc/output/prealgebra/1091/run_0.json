    "problem": "How many positive multiples of $9$ are less than $1000$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First, we'll find the largest multiple of $9$ less than $1000$.  Because $1000 \\div 9 = 111$ remainder 1, the largest multiple of $9$ less than $1000$ is $111 \\cdot 9$, or $999$.\n\nTherefore, every number in the form $n \\cdot 9$ works, as long as $n$ is positive and at most $111$.  There are $111$ such values of $n$, so there are $\\boxed{111}$ multiples of $9$ that are less than $1000$.",

We need to count the multiples of 9 that are less than 1000.\nThe multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, ..., 999\nSo, we need to find the number of terms in the sequence 9, 18, 27, ..., 999.\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is: an = a1 + (n - 1)d\nwhere a1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\nWe know that the first term a1 = 9 and the last term a_n = 999. The common difference d = 9.\n999 = 9 + (n - 1)(9)\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n990 = (n - 1)(9)\nDivide both sides by 9:\n110 = n - 1\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n111 = n\nFinal Answer.",
