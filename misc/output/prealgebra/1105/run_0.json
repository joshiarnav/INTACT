    "problem": "Alison wants to approximate the cost of her basket of groceries. She bought a cake for $17.86$ dollars, a bag of apples for $7.46$ dollars, and a bag of celery for $8.66$ dollars. Which of the following is the closest to the actual cost of the groceries?\n\n$\\bullet$ A. $50$ dollars\n\n$\\bullet$ B. $38$ dollars\n\n$\\bullet$ C. $34$ dollars\n\n$\\bullet$ D. $26$ dollars\n\n$\\bullet$ E. $20$ dollars\n\nExpress your answer as A, B, C, D, or E.",

    "solution": "We can round $17.86$ dollars to $18$ dollars, $7.46$ dollars to $7$ dollars, and $8.66$ dollars to $9$ dollars. The approximate cost of the groceries is $18+7+9=34$ dollars, which is answer choice $\\boxed{\\text{C}}.$\n\nNote that a calculator gives the answer $33.98$ for the actual cost, which confirms that answer choice C is the closest to the actual cost.",
