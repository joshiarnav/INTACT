    "problem": "A railroad trestle spans a gorge 80 feet wide and connects two cliffs at heights of 112 and 172 feet above the bottom of the gorge. A train is crossing this gorge from the higher cliff to the lower. When the front of the train has traveled $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the trestle's length, how many feet is it above the bottom of the gorge?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the railroad trestle is a straight path connecting the two cliffs, we know that after the train has traveled $3/4$ of the trestle's length, the train has traveled both $3/4$ the horizontal distance between the two cliffs and the $3/4$ of the vertical distance between the cliffs' heights. The difference between the heights of the two cliffs is $172-112=60$ feet. $3/4$ of that difference is $45$ feet. Since the train started from the higher cliff and was moving toward the lower cliff, it has descended $45$ feet from its original altitude of $172$ feet. Therefore, the train is now $172-45=\\boxed{127}$ feet above the bottom of the gorge.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let $x$ be the total length of the trestle, and let $y$ be the height of the train above the bottom of the gorge when the front of the train has traveled $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the trestle's length.\nStep 2: We can use similar triangles to solve for $y$. The triangles have the same angle, so their corresponding sides are proportional.\nStep 3: Let $z$ be the height of the rear of the train above the bottom of the gorge, and let $w$ be the height of the front of the train above the bottom of the gorge. Since the front of the train has traveled $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the trestle's length, the height $w$ of the train above the bottom of the gorge is the same as the height of the point on the higher cliff directly below the front of the train, which is 112 feet.
