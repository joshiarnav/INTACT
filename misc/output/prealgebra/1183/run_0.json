    "problem": "Elodie is putting on a fashion show and has five fabulous outfits for her five fabulous fashion models. However, on the day of the show, two of the outfits were ruined in an unfortunate permanent marker incident. Regardless, the show must go on and the remaining outfits will be presented. If each outfit can only be worn by one model and there is no time for any model to wear more than one dress, how many different shows can Elodie put on? (Note: Two shows are considered the same if they contain the same models wearing the same dresses.)",

There are five models available for the first outfit, four models available for the second outfit, and three models available for the third outfit.
