    "problem": "On a particular January day, the high temperature in Lincoln, Nebraska, was $16$ degrees higher than the low temperature, and the average of the high and the low temperatures was $3\\,^\\circ$. In degrees, what was the low temperature in Lincoln that day?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the high temperature is $16$ degrees higher than the low temperature, it follows that the average of the two temperatures, which lies halfway between the high and low temperatures, must be $8$ degrees higher than the low temperature and $8$ degrees lower than the high temperature. Thus, if the average is $3^\\circ,$ then the low temperature is $3^\\circ - 8^\\circ = \\boxed{-5^\\circ}.$",
