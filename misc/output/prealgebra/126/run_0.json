    "problem": "What is $10.0000198\\cdot 5.9999985401\\cdot 6.9999852$ to the nearest whole number?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Notice that $10.00001988$ is very close to $10$, $5.9999985401$ is very close to $6$ and $6.9999852$ is very close to $7$. Because the given numbers are all so close to integers, we're unlikely to go wrong by rounding before multiplying. We get $$10\\cdot6\\cdot7=\\boxed{420}.$$If we multiplied the given numbers with a calculator we would get $$6.9999852\\cdot5.9999985401\\cdot10.00001988=419.999844...$$which would still round to $420$.",
