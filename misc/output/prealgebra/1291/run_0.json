    "problem": "A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \\[\nx+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \\implies 8x = 540 \\implies x=135/2.\n\\] The large angles each measure $2x=\\boxed{135}$ degrees.",

Therefore, the sum of the measures of the five angles is 540. Since the measure of the two congruent acute angles is 2x, and the measures of the other three angles are 2x, we can substitute these values into the equation 2x + 2x + 2x + x + x = 540, yielding 8x = 540.\nStep 4: Solve for x: x = 540/8.",
