    "problem": "What is the perimeter, in units, of a rhombus if its area is 120 square units and one diagonal is 10 units?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The diagonals of a rhombus divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles, the legs of which are half-diagonals of the rhombus.  Let $a$ and $b$ be the half-diagonal lengths of the rhombus.  The area of the rhombus is 4 times the area of one of the right triangles, in other words $4\\times\\frac{1}{2}ab=2ab$.  Since $a=5$ units and the area of the rhombus is $120$ square units, we find $b=120/(2\\cdot5)=12$ units.  The perimeter is 4 times the hypotenuse of one of the right triangles: \\[\n\\text{Perimeter}=4\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}=4\\sqrt{5^2+12^2}=4\\cdot13=\\boxed{52}\\text{ units}.\n\\]",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Recall that the area of a rhombus can be found using the formula A = (d1 * d2) / 2, where A is the area, and d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus.\nStep 2: Let d2 be the unknown diagonal of the rhombus. Then, we have (10 * d2) / 2 = 120.\nStep 3: Simplify and solve for d2: 5d2 = 120, d2 = 120 / 5, d2 = 24.\nStep 4: Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of one side of the rhombus, which is half of each diagonal. So, we have a right triangle with legs 5 and 12, and we can use the theorem to find the hypotenuse, which is the side length of the rhombus.\nStep 5: Apply the Pythagorean theorem: side^2 = 5^2 + 12^2, side^2 = 25 + 144, side^2 = 169, side = \u221a169 = 13.\nStep 6: The perimeter of the rhombus is the sum of all its sides, and since all sides of a rhombus are equal, the perimeter is 4 times the length of one side, so perimeter = 4 * 13.\nStep 6: Perimeter = 4 * 13.
