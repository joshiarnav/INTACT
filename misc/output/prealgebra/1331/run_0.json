    "problem": "A number is doubled, then decreased by $13.7$.  The result is greater than $125.28$. What is the smallest integer that satisfies this condition?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the desired integer. Then $2x-13.7>125.28$.  Adding $13.7$ to both sides gives $2x>138.98$, and dividing both sides by $2$ gives $x>69.49$.  The smallest integer that is greater than $69.49$ is $\\boxed{70}$.",
