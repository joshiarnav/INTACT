    "problem": "Kent won $25\\%$ of the games he played on Saturday. If he lost 12 games on Saturday, and no game ended in a tie, how many games did he win?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If Kent won $25\\%$ of the games, he lost $75\\%$ of them.  Thus if $g$ is the total number of games he played,\n\n$$12=0.75(g)\\Rightarrow g=16$$\n\nSo the number of games he won was $16-12=\\boxed{4}$.",
