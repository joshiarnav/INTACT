    "problem": "How many odd five-digit counting numbers can be formed by  choosing digits from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ if digits can be repeated?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know a number is odd if and only if its unit digit is odd. so we have 4 choices for its units digit. Then we have 7 choices for each of the other digits, yielding $7\\times7\\times7\\times7\\times4=\\boxed{9604}$ numbers.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the restrictions on the last digit of the five-digit number.\nThe last digit must be odd, so it can be 1, 3, 5, or 7.\nStep 2: For each of the four choices for the last digit, determine the number of choices for each of the other four digits.\nThere are 7 choices for each of the first four digits, since digits can be repeated.\nStep 3: Use the multiplication principle to find the total number of odd five-digit counting numbers.\nThe total number of odd five-digit numbers is the product of the number of choices for each of the five digits, which is \\(4\\cdot 7\\cdot 7\\cdot 7\\cdot 7=4\\cdot 7^{4}\\).\nStep 4: \n\\[4\\cdot 7^{4}=4\\cdot 2401=4\\cdot 2401=9604\\]\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9604.",
