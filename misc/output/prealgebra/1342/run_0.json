    "problem": "In Heidi's history class, the only grades that count toward the semester average are the $6$ tests she has already taken and the upcoming final exam. The final exam counts as two tests. Heidi has determined that if she earns $99$ points on the final she will have exactly a $90$-point average for the semester. On average, how many points has Heidi scored on each test prior to the final exam?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Set the average for her previous exams to be $x$. The total amount of points including the final will be $6x+2 \\cdot 99$. The average is $\\frac{6x+2 \\cdot 99}{8}=90$. Then we solve for $x$. $$\\frac{6x+2 \\cdot 99}{8}=90 \\rightarrow 6x+198=720 \\rightarrow 6x=522 \\rightarrow x=\\boxed{87}.$$",
