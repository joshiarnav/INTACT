    "problem": "Quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a trapezoid with $AB$ parallel to $CD$. We know $AB = 20$ and $CD = 12$. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ACB$ to the area of the trapezoid $ABCD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the length of the height of trapezoid $ABCD$ be $h$; note that this is also the length of the height of triangle $ACB$ to base $AB$.  Then the area of $ABCD$ is $\\frac{20 + 12}{2}\\cdot h = 16h$.  On the other hand, the area of triangle $ACB$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 20\\cdot h = 10h$.  Thus the desired ratio is $\\frac{10}{16} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{8}}$.",
