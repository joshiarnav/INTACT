    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We want $xy=54=2 \\cdot 3^3$ such that $x$ is at least $2$ and $y$ is at least  $5$. Thus, the possible combinations $(x,y)$ are $(2,27)$, $(3,18)$, $(6,9)$, and $(9,6)$. There are $\\boxed{4}$ such combinations.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: The problem involves distributing 54 cards to x players, with each player getting y cards. We need to find the number of possible values of x, given that x is at least 2 and y is at least 5.\nStep 2: Since each player gets y cards, the total number of cards will be the product of the number of players (x) and the number of cards each player gets (y), so x*y = 54. We need to find the possible values of x.\nStep 3:\nFind the factors of 54 that are greater than or equal to 2.\nSince 54 = 2 * 3^3, the possible values of x are the factors of 54 that are greater than or equal to 2: 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, and 54.\nStep 4: There are 6 possible values of x.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",
