    "problem": "What is the smallest 9 digit number of the form $aaa, \\! aaa, \\! aaa$ such that it is divisible by 9? (Notice that all the digits of this number must be the same!)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. If the number is of the above form, then the sum of its digits is $a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a=9a$. Thus, whatever digit $a$ is, the sum of its digits will always be divisible by 9. Thus, to minimize the 9 digit number, the number is $\\boxed{111, \\! 111, \\! 111}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: The divisibility rule for 9 states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\nStep 2: To find the smallest 9-digit number with the same digit repeated 3 times, let the digit be $a$. The number is thus $111, \\! 111, \\! 111a$.\nStep 3: To find the smallest $a$ such that $3a$ is divisible by 9, we must look for the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than or equal to $3 \\cdot 1$.\nStep 4: The smallest multiple of 9 greater than or equal to $3 \\cdot 1$ is $9 \\cdot 2 = 18$, thus $a = 6$.\nStep 5: The smallest 9-digit number of the form $aaa, \\! aaa, \\! aaa$ such that it is divisible by 9 is thus $666, \\! 666, \\! 666$.\nStep 6: The smallest 9-digit number of the form $aaa, \\! aaa, \\! aaa$ such that it is divisible by 9 is $666, \\! 666, \\! 666$.\nStep 7: The smallest 9-digit number of the form $aaa, \\! aaa, \\! aaa$ such that it is divisible by 9 is $666, \\! 666, \\! 666$.\nStep 8: $a = 6$.\nStep 9: $111, \\! 111, \\! 1116$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 666,666,666.",
