    "solution": "Since $28=2^2\\cdot 7$, a positive integer is relatively prime with $28$ if and only if it contains neither $2$ nor $7$ in its prime factorization. In other words, we want to count the number of integers between $11$ and $29$ inclusive which are divisible by neither $2$ nor $7$.\n\nAll of the odd numbers are not divisible by 2; there are 10 such numbers.
