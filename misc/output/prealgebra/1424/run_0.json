Since the perimeter of a rectangle is given by P = 2(l + w), we have 60 = 2(x + x).\n$60=2(2x)$\nDivide both sides by 2 to get 30 = 2x.\nDivide both sides by 2 to get $x=15$.\nSince the rectangle consists of two squares placed side by side, its area is given by A = (length)(width) = (x)(x) = x^2. Substituting x = 15 into this equation gives 15^2 = 225.\nSubstitute 15 for x in the equation A = x^2.\nEvaluate $15^2$ to get 225.\nSubstitute 225 for A to get $A=225.$\n$A=225.$\nMultiply 15 by 15 to get $225$.",
