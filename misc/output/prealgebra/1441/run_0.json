    "problem": "Let $n$ be the smallest composite number such that it can be written as the product of two positive integers that differ by 10.  How many distinct prime factors does $n$ have?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The smallest pair of numbers that differ by 10 is 1 and 11; however, they multiply to 11 which is not composite.  We try the next pair up: 2 and 12, which multiply to 24 which is composite, so $n=24$. $24$ factors as $2^3 \\cdot 3$, so it has $\\boxed{2}$ prime factors: 2 and 3.",

Test each pair to see if their product is a composite number, starting with the pair that would produce the smallest product.\nStep 2: Test the pair (3, 13) to see if their product 39 is composite. Since 39 = 3 * 13, it is not composite, so try the pair (4, 14).\nStep 3: Test the pair (4, 14) to see if their product 56 is composite. Since 56 = 2^3 * 7, it is composite, so n = 56.\nStep 4: Factorize the composite number 56 into its prime factors to determine the number of distinct prime factors it has.\nStep 4: \n56 = 2^3 * 7\nStep 5:\n2 distinct prime factors\nStep 6: The number n = 56 has 2 distinct prime factors: 2 and 7.\nStep 4: \n56 = 2^3 * 7",
