Kelly drove for $9+12=21$ miles at a rate of 42 miles per hour, so she drove for $21/42=.5$ hours which equals 30 minutes.  Brenda drove for 15 miles at an average rate of 45 miles per hour, so she drove for $15/45\\cdot 60=20$ minutes.  Thus, Brenda arrived $30-20=\\boxed{10}$ minutes earlier than Kelly.",
