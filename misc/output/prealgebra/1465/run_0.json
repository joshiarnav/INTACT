For instance, if the answer to all six questions were 'yes,' then the answer would be $1+2+3+4+5+6=21$.\n\n1. Is $\\frac{2}{3x}$ equivalent to $\\frac{2x}{3}$?\n\n2. Is $\\frac{1-h}{2h}$ equivalent to $\\frac{h-1}{2h}$?\n\n3. Is $-(u+u^2)$ equivalent to $-u-u^2$?\n\n4. Is $-(3+y)$ equivalent to $-3+y$?\n\n5. Is $\\frac{j}{2}$ equivalent to $\\frac{1}{2}j$?\n\n6. Is $x+y+z$ equivalent to $y+x+z$?",

    "solution": "Recall that two expressions are equivalent if they are equal for all valid choices of the variable or variables involved.\n\nQuestion 1:  no, because the given expressions are equal only for certain values of $x$. Almost any $x$ will do: take $x=2$ and note that $\\frac{2}{3(2)}=\\frac{1}{3}$ while $\\frac{2(2)}{3}=\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nQuestion 2: no, because the second expression is $-1$ times the first expression. Thus they are only equal if each of them happens to equal 0. For example, if $h=3$, then $\\frac{1-h}{2h}=\\frac{1-3}{2(3)}=\\frac{-2}{6}=-\\frac{1}{3}$, while $\\frac{h-1}{2h} = \\frac{3-1}{2(3)} = \\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nQuestion 3: yes, because we obtain the second expression by distributing the negative sign across the parentheses in the first expression.\n\nQuestion 4: no, because the negative sign has not been properly distributed. To confirm that the expressions are not equivalent, we can choose a value like $y=3$ to find that the first expression becomes $-(3+3)=-6$ while the second expression is $-3+3=0$.\n\nQuestion 5: yes, because we can multiply $\\frac{1}{2}$ by $j$ in the usual way by writing $j$ as $\\frac{j}{1}$. We get \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}j = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{j}{1} = \\frac{1\\cdot j}{2\\cdot 1} = \\frac{j}{2}.\n\\]\n\nQuestion 6: yes, by the commutative property of addition.\n\nThe questions whose answers are yes are 3, 5, and 6. The sum of these numbers is $\\boxed{14}$.",
