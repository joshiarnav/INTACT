    "problem": "A circle is inscribed in a square with perimeter of 32 inches. What is the circumference of the circle, in inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the square's side length.  The side length of the square is $(32\\text{ in.})/4=8$ inches. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is $\\pi\\cdot(8\\text{ in.})=\\boxed{8\\pi}$ inches.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Find the length of one side of the square by dividing the perimeter by 4.\nside length $= \\frac{32}{4}$\nside length $= 8$\nStep 2: The diameter of the inscribed circle is equal to the side length of the square, which is 8 inches. The radius of the circle is half of the diameter. So, the radius is $8\\div2=4$ inches.\nStep 3: The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C=2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Substitute the radius of the inscribed circle, 4 inches, into the formula and simplify.\n$C=2\\pi (4)$\n$C=8\\pi$\nStep 4: Since the circumference of the inscribed circle is $8\\pi$ inches, the final answer is $8\\pi$.",
