    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $s$ be the side length of the regular hexagon.  The side length of the equilateral triangle is also equal to $s$.  Solving $3s=39\\text{ inches}$ gives $s=13$ inches, so the perimeter of the hexagon is $6s=6(13\\text{ in.})=\\boxed{78}$ inches.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(10mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\n\nint i;\n\nfor(i=1;i<=6;++i)\n{\n\ndraw(dir(60*i)--dir(60*(i+1)));\n}\n\nfor(i=1;i<=3;++i)\n{\n\ndraw(dir(60*i)--dir(60*(i+3)));\n}[/asy]",
