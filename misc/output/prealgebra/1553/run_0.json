    "problem": "Two interior angles of a convex pentagon are right angles and the other three interior angles are congruent. In degrees, what is the measure of one of the three congruent interior angles?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$. The pentagon has 5 sides, so the sum of the interior angles is $180\\cdot3$. We subtract the degree measures of the two right angles to get $180\\cdot3-90-90=180\\cdot2$, which is the sum of the measures of the three congruent interior angles. We divide by 3 to get the measure of one of the three congruent interior angles: $\\frac{180\\cdot2}{3}=60\\cdot2=\\boxed{120^\\circ}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  A pentagon has 5 sides, which means that the sum of its interior angles can be calculated using the formula (n - 2) * 180, where n is the number of sides.\nThe sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (5 - 2) * 180 = 3 * 180 = 540 degrees.\nStep 2: Two of the interior angles are right angles, which means each of these angles is 90 degrees. Therefore, the sum of these two angles is 2 * 90 = 180 degrees.\nStep 3: Subtract the sum of the two right angles from the total sum of the pentagon's interior angles to find the sum of the three congruent angles: 540 - 180 = 360 degrees.\nStep 4: Divide the sum of the three congruent angles by 3 to find the measure of one of the congruent interior angles: 360 / 3 = 120 degrees.\nStep 4: Divide the sum of the three congruent angles by 3 to find the measure of one of the congruent interior angles: 360 / 3 = 120 degrees.",
