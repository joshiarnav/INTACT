    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We must count the numbers in the list \\[2001, 2002, 2003, \\ldots, 7999.\\] Subtracting 2000 from each number in the list gives \\[1,2,3,\\ldots, 5999,\\] so there are $\\boxed{5999}$ numbers in the list.",

The thousands digit can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, so there are 5 choices for the thousands digit. The hundreds, tens, and ones digits can each be any digit from 0 to 9, so there are 10 choices for each of the hundreds, tens, and ones digits.\nStep 3: Multiply the number of choices for each digit to determine the total number of four-digit integers that are less than 8000 and greater than 2000: \\(5 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = 5000\\)\nStep 4: The total number of four-digit integers that are less than 8000 and greater than 2000 is 5000.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5000.",
