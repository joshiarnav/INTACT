    "problem": "Chris and Nathan order a giant cookie together. If Chris eats $\\frac{2}{7}$ of the cookie and Nathan eats $\\frac{3}{5}$ of the cookie, what fraction of the original cookie is left?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The total amount eaten is $\\frac{2}{7} + \\frac{3}{5}$. The denominators have a common multiple of 35, so this is equivalent to $\\frac{10}{35} + \\frac{21}{35} = \\frac{10 + 21}{35} = \\frac{31}{35}$. Thus, the amount that Chris and Nathan didn't eat is $1 - \\frac{31}{35} = \\frac{35}{35} - \\frac{31}{35} = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{35}}.$",
