    "problem": "Two right triangles have equal areas. The first triangle has a height of 5 cm and a corresponding base of 8 cm. The second triangle has a leg of length 20 cm. What is the length of the other leg of the second triangle, in cm?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since in a triangle $A = \\frac{1}{2} bh$, we see that the product of the base and height must be the same in both triangles.  So $5\\cdot 8 = \\text{(second triangle's base)}\\cdot20$, meaning that the second triangle's base is $\\boxed{2}$ centimeters.",
