    "problem": "If no one shares an office, in how many ways can 3 people be assigned to 5 different offices? (Each person gets exactly one office).",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If we number the three people 1, 2, and 3, there are $5$ offices that person 1 can be assigned to, $4$ offices that person 2 can be assigned to, and $3$ offices that person 3 can be assigned to. This gives us $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 = \\boxed{60}$ ways to assign the three people to offices.",
