    "problem": "Kelly's art teacher asked him to draw a rectangle with a length of $6$ inches and a width of $10$ inches.  After Kelly does so, his teacher changes her mind and asks him to draw a proportional rectangle that has a length of $9$ inches.  How many inches wide is the new rectangle?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the two rectangles are proportional, the ratio of the lengths will be equal to the ratio of the widths.  The ratio of length of the new rectangle to the length of the old rectangle is $\\frac{9}{6}$ and thus the desired width is $10 \\times \\frac {9}{6}=\\boxed{15}$ inches.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Set up a proportion using the given length and width of the original rectangle and the new length and unknown width of the new rectangle.\nStep 2: Cross-multiply the equation $\\frac{6}{10}=\\frac{9}{x}$ to get $6x = 90$.\nStep 3: Solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation 6x = 90 by 6.\nStep 4: \n\\frac{6x}{6} = \\frac{90}{6}\nStep 5: \nx = 15\nx = 15 is the correct answer, but there is no step to justify it.\nx = 15\nx = 15",
