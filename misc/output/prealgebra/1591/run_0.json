Let's assume that $AB = CD = x$ and $AD = BC = y$.\nStep 2:  We are given that the area of rectangle $ABCD$ is 72. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. So, the area of $ABCD$ is $xy = 72.$\nStep 3:  We can use the information that the midpoints of $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ lie on the diagonals to find the length of these diagonals. Since $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ respectively, the diagonals $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{BD}$ bisect each other.
