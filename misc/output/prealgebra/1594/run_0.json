    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "As the minute hand moves $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way around the clock face from 12 to 4, the hour hand will move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way from 4 to 5.  So the hour hand will move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of $\\frac{1}{12}$ of $360^\\circ$, or $\\boxed{10^\\circ}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Calculate the position of the hour hand at 4:20 a.m.\nHour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours = 30 degrees per hour.\nHour hand moves 30 degrees per hour * 4 hours = 120 degrees for 4 hours.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, the hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour * (20/60) = 10 degrees for 20 minutes.\nThe total movement of the hour hand is 120 + 10 = 130 degrees.\nMinute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes = 6 degrees per minute.\nMinute hand moves 6 degrees per minute * 20 minutes = 120 degrees.\nStep 2: Find the absolute value of the difference between the positions of the hour hand and the minute hand. |120 - 130| = | -10 | = 10 degrees.\nStep 3: The absolute value of the difference between the positions of the hour hand and the minute hand is the measure of the acute angle. The angle is 10 degrees.\nStep 4: Since the absolute value of the difference between the positions of the hour hand and the minute hand is the measure of the acute angle, the acute angle formed by the hands of the clock is 10 degrees.\nHowever, since the problem states the angle must be expressed as a number of degrees, the answer is 10 degrees.\nSince the problem is asking for the measure of the acute angle formed by the hands of a clock and the calculated angle is already acute (10 degrees), no further steps are required.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10 degrees.",
