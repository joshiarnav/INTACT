    "problem": "At the candy store, a chocolate bar costs $c$ dollars and a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar. Jamie buys a chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, and Kevin buys five chocolate bars. How much money, in total, do Jamie and Kevin spend at the candy store in terms of $c$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since each chocolate bar costs $c$ dollars, each vanilla bar costs $c+2$ dollars. Jamie spends $c+3(c+2)$ dollars, and Kevin spends $5c$ dollars. Their total, in dollars, is thus \\[c+3(c+2)+5c=c+3c+6+5c=\\boxed{9c+6}.\\]",
