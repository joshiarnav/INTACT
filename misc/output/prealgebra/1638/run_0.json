    "problem": "If the square root of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is 2 units, what is the sum of the squares of the length of the two other sides?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $c$ represent the length of the hypotenuse. We're told that $\\sqrt{c}=2$, so $c=4$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the sum of the squares of the length of the two other sides equals the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($a^2+b^2=c^2$), so our answer is $c^2=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Let the length of the hypotenuse be c, and the lengths of the other two sides be a and b. According to the Pythagorean theorem, a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Since \u221ac = 2, we have c = (\u221ac)^2 = 2^2 = 4.\nSubstitute c = 4 into the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2 to get a^2 + b^2 = 4^2 = 16.\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that a^2 + b^2 = c^2, but we want to find a^2 + b^2.\nSince a^2 + b^2 = 16, the sum of the squares of the length of the two other sides is 16. Final Answer",
