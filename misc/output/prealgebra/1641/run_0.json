    "solution": "When we divide 63 by 5, we get a quotient of 12 and a remainder or 3. In other words, $63=12 \\cdot 5 + 3$. Substituting this into our fraction, we find \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{63}{5} &= \\frac{12 \\cdot 5 + 3}{5} \\\\\n&=\\frac{12 \\cdot 5}{5} + \\frac{3}{5} \\\\\n&=\\frac{12 \\cdot \\cancel{5}}{\\cancelto{1}{5}} + \\frac{3}{5} \\\\\n&=12 + \\frac{3}{5} \\\\\n&=\\boxed{12\\frac{3}{5}}.\n\\end{align*}",
