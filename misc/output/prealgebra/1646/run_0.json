    "solution": "Triangle $AFD$ must have a total angle measure of $180^\\circ$. We know that the other two angles have measures of $2x$ and $2y$, so angle $AFD$ must have a measure of $180-2x-2y=180-(2x+2y)$ degrees. We now look at quadrilateral $ABCD$, whose interior angle measures must sum to $360^\\circ$. Therefore, we have that $110^\\circ +100^\\circ +3y+3x=360^\\circ$, so $3x+3y=150^\\circ$. We want to find $2x+2y$, so we multiply both sides of the equation by $2/3$ to get that $2x+2y=100^\\circ$. We can now substitute in $100^\\circ$ for $2x+2y$ to find that the measure of angle $AFD$ is $180-(2x+2y)=180-100=\\boxed{80}$ degrees.",
