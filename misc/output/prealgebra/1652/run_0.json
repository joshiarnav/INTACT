    "problem": "A chocolate chip cookie recipe calls for 15 cups of flour for 20 dozen cookies. How many cups of flour are needed for 144 cookies?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Converting 144 to 12 dozen, we see that we are making $\\frac{12}{20}=\\frac{3}{5}$ as many cookies as the recipe makes.  Therefore, we need $\\frac{3}{5}$ as much flour, which is $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot15=\\boxed{9}$ cups.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of cups of flour needed for 1 cookie\nTo find the amount of flour needed for one cookie, we need to divide the total cups of flour by the total number of cookies. Since 20 dozen cookies is the same as 20 * 12 = 240 cookies, we will divide 15 cups of flour by 240 cookies.\n\n15 cups flour / 240 cookies = 1/16 cup flour per cookie\n## Step 2: Calculate the amount of flour needed for 144 cookies\nMultiply the amount of flour needed per cookie by the new number of cookies: (1/16 cup) * 144 cookies = 9 cups flour\n## Step 3: \n9 cups\n## Step 3: \n9 cups",
