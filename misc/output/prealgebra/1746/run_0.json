The area is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{20}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{20}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)=\\frac{400}{2\\cdot 2}=\\boxed{100\\text{ square units}}$.",

In this case, both legs are the base and height, and each has a length of 20/sqrt(2) units.\nStep 4: Calculate 1/2 * (20/sqrt(2)) * (20/sqrt(2)) = 1/2 * 400/2 = 100 square units\nStep 4: The final answer is: 100",
