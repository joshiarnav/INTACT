    "problem": "What is the positive difference between the product of the four smallest prime numbers and the product of the four smallest composite numbers greater than 0?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The four smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7, with product $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 210$.  The four smallest composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, and 9, with product $4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9 = 1728$.  The positive difference is thus $1728 - 210 = \\boxed{1518}$.",
