    "solution": "The angles of a pentagon sum to $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so each angle of a regular pentagon is $540^\\circ/5 = 108^\\circ$.  Therefore, three of these angles sum to $3\\cdot 108^\\circ = 324^\\circ$, which means the indicated angle measures $360^\\circ - 324^\\circ = \\boxed{36^\\circ}$.",
