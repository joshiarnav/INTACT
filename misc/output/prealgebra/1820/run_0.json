    "problem": "An elephant and a lion are currently 1 mile apart. The elephant runs directly away from the lion at 19 miles per hour, while the lion runs directly towards the elephant at 24 miles per hour.  How many minutes will it take for the lion to catch the elephant?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Every hour, the lion runs 24 miles while the elephant runs 19.  Thus, the distance between the two animals closes at a rate of 5 miles every hour.  The lion catches the elephant after this distance has closed 1 mile, which takes $\\frac{1}{5}$ hours to do, or $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 60 = \\boxed{12}$ minutes.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Let's denote the time it takes for the lion to catch the elephant as t (in hours). \n\n1. The distance between the elephant and the lion decreases at a rate of (19 + 24) miles per hour, since they are moving towards each other.\n2. The distance between the elephant and the lion decreases by 1 mile in t hours, so we can express this relationship as 1 = (19 + 24)t.\n3. Multiply both sides of the equation by 1 / (19 + 24) = 1 / 43.\n4. 1 / 43 = t\n5. Multiply both sides of the equation by 60 to convert the answer to minutes: 60(1/43) = t.\n60(1/43) = 1.4 Final Answer",
