    "problem": "Max must take 10 steps to go the same distance as three of his dad's steps. His dad takes 30 steps to walk down the hall. How many steps must Max take to walk down the same hall?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Using the given information, we have the ratio $10 \\text{ Max steps} : 3 \\text{ Dad steps}$. Multiplying both sides by $10$, we get the ratio $100 \\text{ Max steps} : 30 \\text{ Dad steps}$. Thus, $30$ of his dad's steps are the same as $\\boxed{100}$ of his steps.",
