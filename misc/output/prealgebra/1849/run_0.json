    "solution": "Every five-digit palindrome is of the form $ABCBA$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are digits.  A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nThe number $ABCBA$ is divisible by 2 if and only if the digit $A$ is even, so the largest possible digit $A$ is 8.  The number $ABCBA$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits, which is $2A + 2B + C$, is divisible by 3.\n\nThe largest possible digit $B$ is 9, and if $A = 8$, then $2A + 2B + C = C + 34$.  The largest digit $C$ for which $C + 34$ is divisible by 3 is $C = 8$.  Therefore, the largest five-digit palindrome that is divisible by 6 is $\\boxed{89898}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  To find the largest five-digit palindrome that is divisible by 6, first, we need to identify the structure of a five-digit palindrome. It can be represented as $10^4a+10^3+10a+1000$, where $a$ is the center digit.\nStep 2:  We know that a number is divisible by 6 if it is even and divisible by 3. Therefore, to maximize the five-digit palindrome, we will start by examining the divisibility by 3 and then check for evenness.\n\nStep 2:  Given that we want to maximize the palindrome, we will start with the largest possible values for $a$, $b$, and $c$ and then adjust as needed.\n\n\nFor $a=9$, the expression becomes $9999+99b+9+1000$ and it is divisible by 3 but not even.\nStep 3:  To check if the number is even, we need to consider the last digit. This means we need to find the largest possible value of $b$ such that the resulting number is even and divisible by 3.\n\nFor $b=8$, the expression becomes $9999+792+9+1000$ which equals $10800$, and it is divisible by both 3 and 2, making it a multiple of 6.\nStep 4:  Since we've found a palindrome that is divisible by 6, $10809$, we need to continue testing larger values of $b$ to ensure we've found the largest possible five-digit palindrome.\nStep 4:  We have already found a palindrome that is divisible by 6, $10809$. Since it's the largest number we've found so far, we can conclude that it is the largest five-digit palindrome that is divisible by 6.\nStep 5:  Since $10809$ is the largest five-digit palindrome that is divisible by 6, we can conclude that it is the largest five-digit palindrome that is divisible by 6.\nStep 4:  We have already found a palindrome that is divisible by 6, $10809$. Since it's the largest number we've found so far, we can conclude that it is the largest five-digit palindrome that is divisible by 6.",
