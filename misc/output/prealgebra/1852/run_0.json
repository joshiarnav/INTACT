    "problem": "At 3:20, what is the measure in degrees of the lesser angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "At 3:20, the minute hand is at the 4, $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way around the clock, therefore, $120$ degrees from the top.  The hour hand, at the beginning of the hour, started at the 3, but since we are $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way through the hour, the hour hand will have traveled $\\frac{1}{3}$ the arc from 3 to 4.  Therefore, the hour hand is another 10 degrees further clockwise, meaning the measure of the angle between the two hands is $120 - 100 = \\boxed{20\\text{ degrees}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Identify the position of the hour hand and the minute hand at 3:20.\nThe hour hand is at 3.25 hours and the minute hand is at 20 minutes.\nStep 2: Convert the hour hand's position to degrees, which moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, or 30 degrees per hour. Convert the minute hand's position to degrees, which moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, or 6 degrees per minute.\nStep 3: Calculate the degree measure for the hour hand by multiplying the hour hand's position (3.25 hours) by 30 degrees per hour, which is 97.5 degrees. Calculate the degree measure for the minute hand by multiplying the minute hand's position (20 minutes) by 6 degrees per minute, which is 120 degrees.\nStep 4: Subtract the degree measure of the hour hand from the degree measure of the minute hand, which is 120 - 97.5 = 22.5 degrees.\nThe next step is:\nStep 5: Determine whether the lesser angle formed by the hour and minute hand is the angle calculated in Step 4 or the supplementary angle, which is 360 - 22.5 = 337.5 degrees.\nStep 5: Determine whether the lesser angle formed by the hour and minute hand is the angle calculated in Step 4 or the supplementary angle, which is 337.5 degrees.\nStep 5: The minute hand is ahead of the hour hand, so the calculated angle of 22.5 degrees is the lesser angle.\nStep 5: The minute hand is ahead of the hour hand, so the calculated angle of 22.5 degrees is the lesser angle.",
