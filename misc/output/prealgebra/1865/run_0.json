    "solution": "The grade level in which the number of male bus riders is closest to $135\\%$ of the number of female bus riders is the same grade level in which the percentage of male bus riders is closest to $135\\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders. To find what percentage is $135\\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders, we multiply each percentage by $1.35.$ In ninth grade, the percentage is $39.4\\cdot1.35=53.19$ percent. In tenth grade, the percentage is $33.1\\cdot1.35=44.685$ percent. In eleventh grade, the percentage is $13.8\\cdot1.35=18.63$ percent. In twelfth grade, the percentage is $8.6\\cdot1.35=11.61$ percent. From inspection, we see that $135\\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders in twelfth grade is closest to the percentage of male bus riders in twelfth grade. So the answer is $\\boxed{12}.$",
