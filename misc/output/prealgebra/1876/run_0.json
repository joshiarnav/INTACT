    "problem": "One day, 45 frogs were captured from a pond, marked and then returned to the pond. The next day, 40 frogs were observed in the pond, of which 10 had been marked the previous day. Assuming the marked frogs are equally distributed among all the frogs in the pond, what is the best estimate of how many frogs live in the pond?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The marked frogs comprised $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the $40$ observed frogs, so we can estimate that the number of frogs that were captured and marked are one fourth of the total number of frogs. Thus, the total number of frogs can be estimated as $45 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{180}$.",
