    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Based on our knowledge of the decimal expansion of $\\pi$, we can quickly estimate that $200 \\pi \\approx 628.32$. So the largest positive integer less than $200\\pi$ is 628. Therefore, the positive integers are 1, 2, 3, $\\ldots$, 627, 628, for a total of $\\boxed{628}$ positive integers.",
