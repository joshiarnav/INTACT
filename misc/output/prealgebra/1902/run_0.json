    "problem": "Two complementary angles, A and B, have measures in the ratio of 7 to 23, respectively. What is the ratio of the measure of the complement of angle A to the measure of the complement of angle B? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The complement of angle $A$ is just $B$, and the complement of $B$ is $A$.  So we seek the ratio of $B$ to $A$, which is reciprocal of $A$ to $B$, or just $\\boxed{\\frac{23}{7}}$.",

The complement of angle A has a measure of 90 - 7x and the complement of angle B has a measure of 90 - 23x.\nThe ratio of the measure of the complement of angle A to the measure of the complement of angle B is (90 - 7x) / (90 - 23x).\nSimplify the ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 1, which is their greatest common factor, to get the ratio as (90 - 7x)/(90 - 23x).\nDivide both the numerator and denominator by 90 to get the ratio as (1 - 7x/90)/(1 - 23x/90).\nDivide both the numerator and denominator by 1 - 7x/90 to get the ratio as (7x/90)/(23x/90).\nDivide both the numerator and denominator by x to get the ratio as (7/90)/(23/90).\nDivide both the numerator and denominator by 90 to get the ratio as 7/23.\nDivide both the numerator and denominator by 7 to get the ratio as 1/23.\nCancel out the common factor of 7 from the numerator and denominator of the ratio (7/23) to get the ratio as 1/3.\nDivide both the numerator and denominator by 7 to get the ratio as 1/3.",
