    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "From the woman, we know that $$\\text{length of shadow}:\\text{height of object} = 9:6.$$ In other words, the length of an object's shadow is $\\frac{9}{6}$ of the height of the object.  So, the length of the flagpole's shadow is $\\frac{9}{6} \\cdot 20 = \\boxed{30}$ feet.",
