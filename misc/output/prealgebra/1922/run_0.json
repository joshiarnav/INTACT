    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If there are $S$ students at Baker Middle School, then $\\frac{2}{3}S$ students take music.  Setting $\\frac{2}{3}S$ equal to 834 and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{3}{2}$, we find that there are $\\frac{3}{2}\\times 834=\\boxed{1251}$ students at the school.",
