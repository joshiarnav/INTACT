    "problem": "If $2004$ is split after the third digit into a three-digit integer  and a one-digit integer, then the two integers, $200$ and $4$, have  a common factor greater than one.  The years $2005$ and $2006$  each have this same property, too.  What is the first    odd-numbered year after $2006$ that has this property?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We note that $2013$ has the property: since the sum of the digits of 201, $2+0+1=3$, is divisible by $3$, $201$ is itself divisible by $3$. We must now check whether any odd-numbered years before $2013$ have the property. $200$ is not divisible by the prime $7$, so $2007$ does not have this property. Likewise, the sum of the digits of $200$ is $2$, which is not divisible by $3$, so $200$ and $9=3^2$ are relatively prime. Clearly $2011$ does not have the desired property since every natural number is relatively prime to $1$. Thus, the first odd-numbered year after $2006$ that has the desired property is $\\boxed{2013}$.",
