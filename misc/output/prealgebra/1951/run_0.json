    "solution": "Since the four sides of a square are equal in length and the perimeter is $28,$ then each side has length $\\frac{28}{4}=7.$  The area of the square is the product of the length and width, which are each equal to $7.$ Therefore, the area of the square in $\\mbox{cm}^2$ is $7\\times7=\\boxed{49}.$",
