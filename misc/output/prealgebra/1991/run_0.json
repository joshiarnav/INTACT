    "problem": "Navin from Mauritius, Luka from Croatia, and Ian from Botswana are chatting in the lobby of a youth hostel discussing their part-time jobs. They learn that Navin makes 160 rupee per hour, Luka makes 25 kuna per hour, and Ian makes 34 pula per hour. If one US dollar is equivalent to 32.35 Mauritius rupee, 5.18 Croatian kuna, and 6.95 Botswana pula, who would earn the most after working an eight-hour day?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The easiest way to solve this problem is to convert the wages to US dollars and to ignore the eight-hour day. In one hour Navin makes $160\\text{ rupee} \\times \\frac{1\\text{ USD}}{32.35\\text{ rupee}}\\approx 4.95\\; \\text{USD}$. Luka makes $25 \\text{ kuna} \\times \\frac{1\\text{ USD}}{5.18 \\text{ kuna}}\\approx 4.83 \\text{ USD}$. Ian makes $34\\text{ pula} \\times\\frac{1\\text{ USD}}{6.95 \\text{ pula}}\\approx 4.89 \\text{ USD}$. Comparing these numbers, we see that $\\boxed{\\text{Navin}}$ has the highest per-hour wages, and therefore would earn the most in eight hours.",
