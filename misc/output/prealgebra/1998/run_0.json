    "problem": "In how many ways can I arrange four different books on a shelf?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are four slots in which to place four books. Think of filling each slot one at a time. For the first slot, there are four books that could be placed. Then, for the second, there are three, because one book has been placed in the first slot. For the third, there are two, and, for the fourth, one. Thus, there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = \\boxed{24}$ ways to arrange the four different books.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Since we have four different books, we will use the concept of permutations to find the number of arrangements. We start with the total number of items to arrange, which is 4.\nStep 2: We have 4 choices for the first position, 3 choices for the second position, 2 choices for the third position, and 1 choice for the last position.\nStep 3: Multiply the choices together to find the total number of arrangements: 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 =\nStep 4: The product 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 equals 24.\nThere is no need for another step.
