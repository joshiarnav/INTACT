    "problem": "When Marika bought her house she paid $80\\%$ of the purchase price of the house with a loan. She paid the remaining $\\$49,400$ of the purchase price with her savings. What was the purchase price of her house?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since she paid $80\\%$ with loans, and the rest she paid with her savings, $20\\%$ of the purchase price is what she paid with her savings.  Thus, if we call $x$ the total price of the house, we have: $\\frac{x}{5} = 49400 \\rightarrow x = \\boxed{247000}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Let $x$ be the purchase price of the house.\n\n$\\frac{4}{5}x+49,400=x$\nSubtract $\\frac{4}{5}x$ from both sides of the equation to get $49,400 = \\frac{1}{5}x$.\nMultiply both sides by 5 to get $x = 244,000$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 244000. I hope it is correct.",
    "steps": [
        "Let $x$ be the purchase price of the house.\n\n$\\frac{4}{5}x+49,400=x$",
        "Subtract $\\frac{4}{5}x$ from both sides of the equation to get $49,400 = \\frac{1}{5}x$.",
        "Multiply both sides by 5 to get $x = 244,000$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 244000. I hope it is correct."
