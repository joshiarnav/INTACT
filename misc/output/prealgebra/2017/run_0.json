    "problem": "Alice wants to buy $3$ pounds of veal at the grocery store, but the scales at the store only show weight in kilograms. If one kilogram is $2.20$ pounds, how many kilograms of veal should Alice buy?  (You may use a calculator on this problem; answer to the nearest hundredth.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since Alice wants to buy $3$ pounds of veal, we multiply the quantity of $3$ pounds by the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{kg}}{2.20\\ \\text{lb}}$ to obtain $3\\ \\text{lb} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{kg}}{2.20\\ \\text{lb}} \\approx \\boxed{1.36}\\ \\text{kg}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  We want to find out how many kilograms Alice needs to buy in order to have 3 pounds of veal. To do this, we need to use the conversion factor between pounds and kilograms.\nStep 2:  Let $x$ be the number of kilograms of veal Alice needs to buy. We know that $1$ kilogram is equal to $2.20$ pounds. We can set up the equation $2.20x = 3$ since Alice wants to buy 3 pounds of veal.\nStep 2: Solve for $x$: $x = \\frac{3}{2.20}$.\nStep 3:\nx = 1.36\nStep 4: \nSince Alice needs to buy 1.36 kilograms of veal to have 3 pounds, to the nearest hundredth, she needs to buy 1.36 kilograms of veal.\nSince Alice needs to buy 1.36 kilograms of veal to have 3 pounds, to the nearest hundredth, she needs to buy 1.36 kilograms of veal.\nSince Alice needs to buy 1.36 kilograms of veal to have 3 pounds, to the nearest hundredth, she needs to buy 1.36 kilograms of veal.",
