    "problem": "Trae is searching for a treasure on the beach. From point $A$, he is told to walk two meters north, three meters east, and then two meters north to point $B$. In meters, what is the length of $\\overline{AB}$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In total, Trae walked 4 meters north and 3 meters east to get from point $A$ to point $B$. Since 3-4-5 is a Pythagorean triple, the length of $\\overline{AB} = \\boxed{5}$.",
