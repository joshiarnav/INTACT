    "solution": "The two shaded regions combine to form a semicircle. The area of this semicircle is half the area of a circle with radius 4, or $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\pi\\cdot 4^2=8\\pi$. The area of the non-shaded region is equal to the area of the rectangle minus the area of the shaded region, or $8\\cdot4-8\\pi=\\boxed{32-8\\pi}$ square units.",
