    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Setting the mean of the set's members equal to $x - 4.5$, we get the equation \\[\\frac{5+8+10+18+19+28+30+x}{8}=x-4.5.\\]Simplifying the left-hand side, we get \\[\\frac{118+x}{8} = x - 4.5.\\]Multiplying by $8$ gives $118+x = 8x-36$. Then $7x = 118+36=154$. Thus $x=\\frac{154}{7} = \\boxed{22}.$",
