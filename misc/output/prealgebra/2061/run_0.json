    "problem": "What is the $1000^{\\rm th}$ positive integer with an odd number of digits?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are $9$ one-digit positive integers ($1$ through $9$). There are $900$ three-digit positive integers, since there are $100$ three-digit numbers with each hundreds digit from $1$ to $9$. So far, we've counted $909$ positive integers with an odd number of digits. Next are five-digit numbers. Since $909+91=1000$, we're looking for the $91^{\\rm st}$ five-digit number.\n\nThe $1^{\\rm st}$ five-digit number is $10000$, so the $91^{\\rm st}$ five-digit number is $10000+90$, or $\\boxed{10090}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Recognize that to determine the $1000^{\\rm th}$ positive integer with an odd number of digits, we need to find the sequence of numbers with an odd number of digits and identify a pattern or rule for that sequence.\n\nHowever, I can help you with that.\nStep 2:  The numbers with an odd number of digits start with 1-digit numbers, then 3-digit numbers, then 5-digit numbers, and so on.\n  We can list the sequence of numbers with an odd number of digits as $1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, \\ldots, 10^{2n-1}$.\nStep 3:  Since we need to find the $1000^{\\rm th}$ number in this sequence, we can set up the inequality $1 + 9 + 9 \\cdots + 9 = 1000$ to find the number of terms in the sequence that meet the given condition.\nStep 4:  To find the $1000^{\\rm th}$ number with an odd number of digits, we need to find the number $10^{2n-1}$ that corresponds to the $1000^{\\rm th}$ term in the sequence.\n  Since we know there are $5$ terms with $1$ digit, $10$ terms with $3$ digits, $10^2$ terms with $5$ digits, and so on, with the number of terms increasing by a factor of $10$ each time, we can use this pattern to find the number of terms with an odd number of digits.\n  We can set up an inequality $5 + 10 + 10^2 + 10^3 + \\ldots + 10^{n-1} < 1000$ to find the value of $n$.\nStep 5:  The sum of the first $n$ terms of the geometric series $5 + 10 + 10^2 + 10^3 + \\ldots$ is $5\\left(\\frac{10^n-1}{10-1}\\right) = \\frac{5}{9}(10^n-1)$, which must be less than $1000$ to continue the sequence. Therefore, we have $\\frac{5}{9}(10^n-1) < 1000$.\nStep 6:  Multiply both sides by $\\frac{9}{5}$ to obtain $10^n-1 < 1800$, then add $1$ to both sides to get $10^n < 1801$.\nStep 7:\nTake the logarithm base 10 of both sides to obtain $n < \\log_{10} 1801$.\n\nFinal Answer",
