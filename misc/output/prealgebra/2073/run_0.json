    "problem": "Exits on a highway are numbered consecutively from 1 to 50. The distance from exit 41 to exit 50 is 100 km. If each exit is at least 6 km from the next exit, what is the longest possible distance, in kilometers, between exit 47 and exit 48?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To make the distance between exit $47$ and exit $48$ as long as possible, we want to make the distance between any other two consecutive exits as short as possible (that is, $6$ km). There are nine distances between exits from exit $41$ to exit $50$; eight that we want to make as short as possible and one that we want to make as long as possible. Thus, the longest possible distance is $100 - 8 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{52}$ km.",

Therefore, exit 50 is the 41st + 17th = 58th exit, but since the maximum number of exits is 50, the last exit can't be 58th. So the 50th exit must be the 50th, and exit 41 must be the 41st exit, and 16 exits are between them. Let's calculate the distance between each exit. If 16 exits are between exit 41 and exit 50, the distance between each exit is 100 km / 16 = 6.25 km. Since each exit is at least 6 km apart, the distance between exit 47 and exit 48 must be at least 6 km.\nStep 4:\nWe want the longest possible distance between exit 47 and exit 48. The distance between exit 47 and exit 50 is 3 exits. Since each exit is at least 6 km apart, the distance between exit 47 and exit 50 is at least 3 \u00d7 6 km = 18 km. The distance between exit 47 and exit 48 is at most 18 km - 6 km = 12 km.\nStep 5:\nThe longest possible distance between exit 47 and exit 48 is 12 km + 6 km = 18 km.\nStep 6: \nSince the longest possible distance between exit 47 and exit 50 is 18 km, the longest possible distance between exit 47 and exit 48 must be the 18 km - 6 km = 12 km.\nStep 4:\nThe distance between exit 47 and exit 50 is 3 exits.
