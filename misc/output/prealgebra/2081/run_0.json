    "solution": "First, we take the prime factorization of both $91$ and $26$ so as to find their greatest common factor (also called the greatest common divisor.) We get $91=7\\cdot 13$ and $26=2\\cdot 13.$ Both $91$ and $26$ are divisible by $13,$ and they have no other common factors, so the greatest common factor is $13.$ We divide both the numerator and the denominator by $13$ to get $\\frac{91}{26}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}.$",
