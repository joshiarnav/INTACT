    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To find a positive number that is both a multiple of $6$ and a multiple of $8$, we'll list out the multiples of $6$, starting with $6$, and check to see if any of them are also multiples of $8$. $6$ does not divide $8$, so it isn't a multiple of $8$. $12$ and $18$ are also not evenly divisible by $8$, so they do not work, either.  $24$ is evenly divisible by $8$ (as $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$), so $\\boxed{24}$ is the smallest positive multiple of both $6$ and $8$.",
