    "problem": "What is the value of $x$ if $-\\frac23(x-5) = \\frac32(x+1)$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First we get rid of the fractions by multiplying both sides by 6.  This gives us  \\[6\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}(x-5)\\right) = 6\\left(\\frac32(x+1)\\right),\\] so  \\[-4(x-5) = 9(x+1).\\] Expanding both sides gives $-4x + 20 = 9x + 9$.  Adding $4x$ to both sides and subtracting 9 from both sides gives $11 = 13x$, so $x = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{13}}$.",
