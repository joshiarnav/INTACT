    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the number of choices for each course. There are 5 choices for the appetizer, 8 choices for the entree, and 4 choices for the dessert.\nStep 2: Multiply the number of choices for each course to find the total number of three-course meals. Total = 5 * 8 * 4\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of three-course meals. Total = 5 * 8 * 4 = 160\nThe final step of the solution is the calculation of the total number of meals, which is already provided in the previous response.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{160}$",
