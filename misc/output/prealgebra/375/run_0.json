    "problem": "Dawn has $\\$ $1.20 in nickels, dimes and quarters. For each nickel she has one dime and for each dime she has one quarter. How many total coins does she have?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If Dawn has $x$ nickels, then she has $x$ dimes and $x$ quarters. In cents, we set up an equation for how much money she has. \\begin{align*}\n5x+10x+25x&=120\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n40x&=120\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx&=3\n\\end{align*} She has $3$ of each coin for a total of $\\boxed{9}$ coins.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Let $n$ be the number of nickels, $d$ be the number of dimes, and $q$ be the number of quarters that Dawn has.\nSince for each nickel she has one dime and for each dime she has one quarter, then the number of dimes is equal to the number of nickels and the number of quarters is equal to the number of dimes, which is also equal to the number of nickels. Therefore, $d = n$ and $q = n$.\nSince the number of nickels is equal to the number of dimes and the number of dimes is equal to the number of quarters, $n = d = q$.\n\nFinal Answer:",
