    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Two numbers are relatively prime if they share no prime factors.  Therefore, the desired positive integer must not share any prime factors with the product of the first 20 positive integers.  So, every prime in the prime factorization of the desired positive integer is greater than 20, which means the smallest possible integer is $\\boxed{23}$.",
