    "problem": "A rhombus has a perimeter of $68$ units and one of its diagonals is $30$ units. What is its area in square units?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If a rhombus has a perimeter of 68 units, then its side length must be 17. Since diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, the right triangle that is formed has one leg of length 15 and another leg of length 8. Therefore, the area of one of the right triangles is $\\frac{8 \\times 15}{2} = 60$, so since the rhombus is made up of four congruent right triangles, the area of the rhombus is $60 \\times 4 = \\boxed{240}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Let's denote the lengths of the two diagonals of the rhombus as d1 and d2, and the length of the side as s.\nAssume d1 = 30 units\nStep 2:\nThe perimeter of a rhombus is 4 times the length of its side. We can express this mathematically as 4s = 68, which means s = 68 / 4 = 17 units.\nStep 3:  The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, forming four right triangles. We know that d1 = 30 units, and the side length s = 17 units. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other diagonal, d2.\nStep 4:  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of d2: (d2/2)^2 + (d1/2)^2 = s^2, substituting the known values gives (d2/2)^2 + (30/2)^2 = 17^2.\nStep 5: (d2/2)^2 = 289 - 225\n(d2/2)^2 = 64\nd2/2 = 8\nd2 = 16\nStep 6: The area of a rhombus can be found using the formula A = (1/2) \\* d1 \\* d2, substituting d1 = 30 units and d2 = 16 units.\nStep 7: A = (1/2) * 30 * 16 = 240\nStep 8: The area of the rhombus is 240 square units.\nStep 4: Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of d2: (d2/2)^2 + (d1/2)^2 = s^2, substituting the known values gives (d2/2)^2 + (30/2)^2 = 17^2.\n(d2/2)^2 + (30/2)^2 = 17^2",
