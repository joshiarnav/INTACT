    "problem": "How many feet long is the shadow of a 15-foot flagpole if a 5-foot woman standing at the base of the flagpole has a shadow that is six feet long?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We have $5 \\text{ foot object} : 6 \\text{ foot shadow}$. We want to find the length of the shadow of a 15-foot object. Multiplying both parts of the ratio by $\\frac{15}{5}=3$, we have $3 \\cdot 5 \\text{ foot object} : 3 \\cdot 6 \\text{ foot shadow} \\Rightarrow 15 \\text{ foot object} : 18 \\text{ foot shadow}$. Thus, the shadow is $\\boxed{18}$ feet long.",
