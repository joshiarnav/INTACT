    "problem": "Robin bought a four-scoop ice cream cone having a scoop each of vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cherry. In how many orders can the four scoops be stacked on the cone if they are stacked one on top of the other and chocolate cannot be on the bottom?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 3 choices for the bottom scoop. Then there are only 3 choices for the scoop above that (since one flavor has already been used), then 2 choices for the next scoop, and 1 choice for the final scoop.  This gives a total of $3\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{18}$ possible cones.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  If chocolate cannot be on the bottom, we will treat it as if there is a position at the bottom for the remaining three flavors, and then place the chocolate scoop on top of one of the flavors.\n\n## Step 2:  The first step is to determine the number of arrangements of the remaining three flavors (vanilla, strawberry, and cherry) without the chocolate scoop.\n## Step 3:  There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the remaining three flavors (vanilla, strawberry, and cherry).\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to account for the placement of the chocolate scoop, which can be placed on top of any of the three flavors.\n## Step 5:  For each arrangement of the three flavors, there are 3 possible positions where the chocolate scoop can be placed.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the four scoops, with chocolate not on the bottom, is 6 * 3 = 18.\n\nFinal Answer",
