    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the two ropes are cut into pieces of length $x$, then both $18$ and $24$ must be divisible by $x$. Therefore, we are looking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $18$ and $24$. We know that $18=2\\cdot 3^2$ and $24=2^3 \\cdot 3$, so their GCD is $2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",
