    "problem": "In Duck Creek, a bicycle license plate consists of one letter followed by one digit; for example, $Q7$ or $J1$. How many different license plates are possible?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 26 different letters in our alphabet, and there are 10 digits in our number system. Multiplying for the two different characters, we have $26 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{260}$ suitable license plates.",
