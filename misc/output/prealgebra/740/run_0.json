    "problem": "In a bag with 20 marbles, five of them are blue. How many blue marbles must be added to the bag so that the probability of selecting a blue marble at random is $\\frac{1}{2}$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If we add $x$ blue marbles, then the fraction of blue marbles in the bag will be $\\frac{5 + x}{20 + x}$. We want this to equal $1/2$, so $\\frac{5 + x}{20 + x}= \\frac{1}{2}$. Clearing the fractions, we have $10 + 2x = 20 + x$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let x represent the number of blue marbles that need to be added to the bag. The total number of marbles after adding x blue marbles will be 20 + x.\nStep 2: The probability of selecting a blue marble at random is given by the ratio of the number of blue marbles to the total number of marbles, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{5+x}{20+x}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 3: Solve the equation $\\frac{5+x}{20+x}=\\frac{1}{2}$ for x.\nStep 4: Cross-multiply the equation to get $2(5+x)=1(20+x)$, then simplify to get $10+2x=20+x$.\nSubtract $x$ from both sides of the equation to get $10+2x-x=20$, then simplify to get $10+x=20$.\nSubtract 10 from both sides of the equation to get $x=10$.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
