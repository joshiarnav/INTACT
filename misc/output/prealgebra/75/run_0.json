    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "You can enter the building through one of 12 different doors. Since only that door is eliminated from the doors for you to exit, there are 11 choices for the exit door. So the total number of ordered pairs of enter, exit doors is $12 \\cdot 11 = \\boxed{132}$.",
