    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since 5 is the median, there must be two integers greater than 5 and two less than 5. The five integers may be arranged this way: $\\underline{\\ \\ \\ }, \\ \\underline{\\ \\ \\ },  \\  5, \\  8, \\ 8$. Since the mean is 5, the sum of all five integers is 25. The numbers 5, 8, and 8 total 21, leaving 4 for the sum of the first two. They can't both be 2 since 8 is the only mode, so they are 1 and 3. The difference between 8 and 1 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
