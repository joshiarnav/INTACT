If the hundredth place is greater than or equal to 5, we round the tenth digit up; otherwise (hundredth is less than 5), we round down (keeping the tenth digit as it was). \\begin{align*}\n543.55 &= 543.6\\\\\n25.23 &= 25.2\\\\\n299.98 &= 300.0.\n\\end{align*}Then add the three numbers: $543.6+25.2+300.0=\\boxed{868.8}\\,$.",
