    "problem": "The angle measures of the three angles of a triangle are in the ratio $1:3:6$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of the largest angle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Because the angle measures are in the ratio $1:3:6$, the angle measures are $x$, $3x$, and $6x$ for some value of $x$.  Because the angles of a triangle add to $180^\\circ$, we have $x+3x+6x = 180^\\circ$, so $10x = 180^\\circ$ and $x =18^\\circ$.  Therefore, the largest angle has measure $6x = \\boxed{108^\\circ}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let the measures of the angles be $x$, $3x$, and $6x$.\nStep 2: The sum of the measures of the three angles of a triangle is $180^{\\circ}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",
