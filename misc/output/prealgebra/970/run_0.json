In order to round to the nearest tenth, we must look at whether the hundredths digit is less than 5, or greater than or equal to 5.\n\nA.\tThe hundredths place in 67.332 is 3, which is less than 5, so the tenths place remains 3. 67.332 rounds to 67.3.\nB.\tThe hundredths place in 67.473 is 7, which is greater than 5, so the tenths place rounds up to 6. 67.473 rounds to 67.5.\nC.\tThe tenths place in 67.526 is 5, so 67.526 can round to only 67.5 or 67.6, not 67.4.\nD.\tThe hundredths place in 67.445 is 4, which is less than 5, so the tenths place remains 4. 67.445 rounds to 67.4.\nE.\tThe hundredths place in 67.346 is 4, which is less than 5, so the tenths place remains 3.\n\nOut of all the answer choices, $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$ is the only one which rounds to 67.4 when rounded to the nearest tenth, so it must be the closest to 67.4.",
