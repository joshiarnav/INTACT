    "problem": "Bobby stands 10 feet from Sam, and Eric stands 8 feet from Bobby. What is the least number of feet that Eric could be from Sam?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Eric is on the circle of radius $8$ centered at Bobby.  The closest point on this circle to Sam is where it intersects the line segment between Bobby and Sam. If Eric is on this line segment, the minimum of $10-8=\\boxed{2}$ feet is obtained.",

    "model_solution": "Draw a diagram of the situation showing the distances between Bobby, Sam, and Eric.\nUse the Pythagorean Theorem to find the minimum distance from Eric to Sam.\nLet x be the distance from Eric to Sam. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to get the equation x^2 = 10^2 + 8^2.\nSimplify the equation to get x^2 = 100 + 64.\nCombine like terms to get x^2 = 164.\nTake the square root of both sides of the equation to get x = \u221a164.\nx = \u221a164 \u2248 \u221a(4*41) = 2\u221a41\nx \u2248 2\u221a41\nx \u2248 2\u221a41 \u2248 2 * 6.4031 \u2248 12.8062\nSince the answer is approximately 12.8062, we can conclude that the least number of feet that Eric could be from Sam is 13, as the distance must be a whole number.",
