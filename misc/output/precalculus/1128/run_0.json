    "solution": "Note that $\\operatorname{lcm}(18,48) = 144.$  So,\n\\[(zw)^{144} = z^{144} w^{144} = (z^{18})^8 \\cdot (w^{48})^3 = 1.\\]Hence, every element in $C$ is a 144th root of unity.\n\nConversely, consider an arbitrary 144th root of unity, say\n\\[\\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi k}{144}.\\]Note that $\\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi (2k)}{18} \\in A$ and $\\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi (-5k)}{48} \\in B,$ and their product is\n\\[\\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi (2k)}{18} \\cdot \\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi (-5k)}{48} = \\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi (16k)}{144} \\cdot \\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi (-15k)}{144} = \\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi k}{144}.\\]Therefore, every 144th root of unity lies in $C,$ which means $C$ is precisely the set of 144th roots of unity.  It follows that $C$ contains $\\boxed{144}$ elements.",
