    "solution": "If we take $x = 3t^2 - 9t - 5$ and $y = t^2 - 3t + 2,$ then\n\\[y = t^2 - 3t + 2 = \\frac{3t^2 - 9t + 6}{3} = \\frac{x + 11}{3}.\\]Thus, the path of the tennis ball traces a line segment.\n\nFurthermore,\n\\[x = 3t^2 - 9t - 5 = 3 \\left( t - \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2 - \\frac{47}{4}.\\]Thus, as $t$ varies from 0 to 4, $x$ varies from $-5$ (at $t = 0$), to $-\\frac{47}{4}$ (at $t = \\frac{3}{2}$), to 7 (at $t = 4$).  The plot below shows the position of the tennis ball as a function of time $t,$ with the time indicated.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.4 cm);\n\nreal t;\n\npair parm (real t) {\n  return((3*t^2 - 9*t - 5,t^2 - 3*t + 2));\n}\n\npath trail = parm(0);\n\nfor (t = 0; t <= 4; t = t + 0.1) {\n  trail = trail--parm(t);\n}\n\ntrail = trail--parm(4);\n\ndraw(trail,red);\n\ndot(\"$0$\", parm(0), NW);\ndot(\"$1$\", parm(1), NW);\ndot(\"$\\frac{3}{2}$\", parm(1.5), W);\ndot(\"$2$\", parm(2), SE);\ndot(\"$3$\", parm(3), SE);\ndot(\"$4$\", parm(4), SE);\n[/asy]\n\nThus, the tennis ball traces the line segment with endpoints $\\left( -\\frac{47}{4}, -\\frac{1}{4} \\right)$ and $(7,6),$ and its length is\n\\[\\sqrt{\\left( 7 + \\frac{47}{4} \\right)^2 + \\left( 6 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^2} = \\boxed{\\frac{25 \\sqrt{10}}{4}}.\\]",
