That means that $b = \\sqrt{2}e^{\\pi i/4} a$, which becomes\n\\begin{align*} \nb &= \\sqrt{2}(\\cos (\\pi/4) + i \\sin(\\pi/4))a \\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{2}\\left( \\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} i\\right)a \\\\\n    &= (1+i)a.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $\\frac{b}{a} = 1+i.$\n\nSimilarly, $c$ is a rotation of $b$ by $\\pi/4$ around the origin, scaled by a factor of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},$  That means $c = \\frac{e^{\\pi i/4}}{\\sqrt{2}} b,$ which becomes\n\\[c = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}/2 + \\sqrt{2}/2 \\cdot i}{\\sqrt{2}} b = \\frac{1 + i}{2} b.\\]Therefore, $\\frac{c}{b} = \\frac{1 + i}{2}.$\n\nThen\n\\[\\frac{ac + b^2}{ab} = \\frac{c}{b} + \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 + i}{2} + 1 + i = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} i}.\\]",
