    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "Since angle $x$ lies in the third quadrant, $\\sin x$ is negative.  Also,\n\\[\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x = 1 - \\frac{400}{841} = \\frac{441}{841},\\]so $\\sin x = -\\frac{21}{29}.$  Therefore,\n\\[\\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\boxed{\\frac{21}{20}}.\\]",
