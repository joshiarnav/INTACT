Hence, $a^2 = 1.$  Then the equations of the planes become $x = 0,$ $y = z,$ and $y = z,$ and their intersection is a line.  Also,\n\\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2abc = 1.\\]Otherwise, at least one of $b$ and $c$ is nonzero, so $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2abc - 1 = 0.$  Hence,\n\\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2abc = 1.\\]We conclude that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2abc$ is always equal to $\\boxed{1}.$",
