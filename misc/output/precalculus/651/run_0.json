    "solution": "We compute \\[\\begin{aligned} PQ &= \\sqrt{(7-8)^2 + (12-8)^2 + (10-1)^2} = 7\\sqrt{2}, \\\\ QR &= \\sqrt{(8-11)^2 + (8-3)^2 + (1-9)^2} = 7\\sqrt{2}, \\\\ PR &= \\sqrt{(7-11)^2 + (12-3)^2 + (10-9)^2} = 7\\sqrt{2}. \\end{aligned}\\]Thus, $PQR$ is an equilateral triangle made from three vertices of a cube. It follows that each side of $PQR$ must be a face diagonal of the cube, so the side length of the cube is $\\boxed{7}.$\n[asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A=(0,0,0),B=(0,0,1),C=(0,1,1),D=(0,1,0),E=A+(1,0,0),F=B+(1,0,0),G=C+(1,0,0),H=D+(1,0,0);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--A^^E--F--G--H--E^^A--E^^B--F^^C--G^^D--H);\ndraw(B--D--E--B,dashed);\nlabel(\"$P$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$Q$\",D,SE);\nlabel(\"$R$\",E,SW);\n[/asy]",
