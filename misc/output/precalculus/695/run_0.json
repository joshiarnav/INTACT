    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "Between 0 and 180 degrees, the value of $\\sin x$ is between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive). Thus, the value of $\\sqrt{\\sin x}$ is between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive). Since the range of $\\log_2 x$ for $0<x\\le1$ is all non-positive numbers, the range of the entire function is all non-positive numbers, or $x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty, 0]}$.",
