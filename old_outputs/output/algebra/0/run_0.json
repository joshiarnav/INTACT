    "solution": "For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must \"meet\" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \\Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\\boxed{0}$.",

        "To solve for $a+b$, we need to ensure the piecewise function is continuous. This means that the different parts of the function must agree at the transition points, which are $x=2$ and $x=-2$. \n\nThe first step is to set up the conditions for continuity at $x=2$. This means we need to set the expressions for $f(x)$ for $x>2$ and $x \\le 2$ equal to each other and solve for $a$. \n\nSo, we set $ax+3 = x-5$ for $x=2$.",
        "To solve for $a$, we need to plug in $x=2$ into the equation $ax+3=x-5$. \n\nThis gives us: $a(2)+3=2-5$\n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\n$2a+3=-3$",

        "Next, we need to set up the conditions for continuity at $x = -2$. This means we need to set the expressions for $f(x)$ for $x<-2$ and $-2 \\le x \\le 2$ equal to each other and solve for $b$. So, we set $2x - b = x - 5$ for $x = -2$.",
        "To find the value of $b$, we plug in $x=-2$ into the equation $2x - b = x - 5$. \n\nThis gives us: $2(-2) - b = -2 - 5$\n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\n$-4 - b = -7$",
