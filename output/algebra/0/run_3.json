    "solution": "For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must \"meet\" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \\Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\\boxed{0}$.",
