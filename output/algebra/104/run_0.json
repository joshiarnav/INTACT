    "problem": "In a 8 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water, there are 125 calories. How many calories would be contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle? Express your answer in decimal form.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that there are 125 calories in 8 fluid ounces of Vitamin Water, so we can set up the proportion $\\frac{125}{8}=\\frac{x}{12}$, where $x$ is the number of calories contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\\left(\\frac{125}{8}\\right)(12)=\\boxed{187.5}$ calories.",

    "model_solution": "Let x be the number of calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water. Set up the proportion 8/125 = 12/x.\nCross-multiply to get 8x = 125*12.\nDivide both sides by 8 to get x = (125*12)/8.\nx = (125*12)/8 = (125*1.5) = 187.5\nx = (125*12)/8 = (125*1.5) = 187.5",
