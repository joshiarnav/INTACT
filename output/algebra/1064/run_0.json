    "problem": "A line has a slope of $-7$ and contains the point $(3,0)$. The equation of this line can be written in the form $y = mx+b$. What is the value of $m+b$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, remember that the slope of a line in the form of $y=mx+b$ is equal to $m$.  So, the line must take the form $y=-7x+b$.  Next, substitute the point $(3,0)$ and solve for $b$: \\begin{align*}\n0&=-7(3)+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=-21+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 21&=b\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the value of $m+b$ is $-7+21=\\boxed{14}$.",
