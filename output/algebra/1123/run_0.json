    "solution": "The fraction $\\frac{1}{2y+1}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero. This occurs when $y$ is the solution of the equation $$2y+1=0,$$ which is $y=-\\frac 12$. Thus the domain of $k(y)$ is $$\\boxed{\\left(-\\infty,-\\frac 12\\right)\\cup \\left(-\\frac 12,\\infty\\right)}.$$",
