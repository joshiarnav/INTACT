    "problem": "A horse 64 feet from the center of a merry-go-round makes 27 revolutions. In order to travel the same distance, how many revolutions would a horse 16 feet from the center have to make?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center.  Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the length of the longer path.  Therefore, 4 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $27\\times4=\\boxed{108}$ revolutions.",
