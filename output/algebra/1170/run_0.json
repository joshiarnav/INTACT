    "solution": "The smallest multiple of 3 between 100 and 200 is 102, and the largest multiple is 198.  Thus, we want to find the sum of the arithmetic series $102 + 105 + \\dots + 198$.\n\nThe $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this arithmetic sequence is $102 + 3(n - 1) = 3n + 99$.  If $3n + 99 = 198$, then $n = 33$, so the number of terms in this sequence is 33.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(102 + 198)/2 \\cdot 33 = \\boxed{4950}.$",
