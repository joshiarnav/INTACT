    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can factor the expression $x-3$ out of each term: \\[2x(x-3) + 3(x-3) = 2x\\cdot (x-3) + 3\\cdot (x-3) = \\boxed{(2x+3)(x-3)}.\\] If you don't quite see how this works, suppose we put $A$ in place of $x-3$ everywhere in the original expression. Then we can see the factoring more clearly: \\[2xA +3A = 2x\\cdot A + 3\\cdot A = (2x+3)A.\\] Putting $x-3$ back in for $A$, we have our factorization: $(2x+3)(x-3)$.",
