    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can manually add $3+4+\\cdots+12$, or we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. We multiply the average of the first and last terms $\\frac{3+12}{2}$ by the number of terms, $12-3+1=10$. The value of the sum is $\\frac{15}{2}\\cdot10=15\\cdot5=75$, so there are $\\boxed{75}$ logs in the stack.",
