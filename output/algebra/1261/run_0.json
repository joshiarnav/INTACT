    "solution": "Subtracting $2x$ from both sides, it follows that $x^2 - 2x - 15 < 0$. This factors as $x^2 - 2x - 15 = (x-5)(x+3) < 0$, from which it follows (by testing values or inspection) that $-3 < x < 5$. Then $a = -2, b = 4$, and $b-a$ is $4 - (-2) = \\boxed{6}$.",

Both factors are positive when $x > 5$ and $x > -3$, so when $x > 5$. Both factors are negative when $x < 5$ and $x < -3$, so when $x < -3$.\nStep 5: The solution to the inequality is $x \\in (-\\infty, -3) \\cup (5, \\infty)$. Since $a$ is the smallest integer satisfying the inequality, $a = -2$. Since $b$ is the largest integer satisfying the same inequality, $b = 6$.
