    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Suppose that  $k = \\sqrt{120 - \\sqrt{x}}$ is an integer. Then $0\\le k \\le \\sqrt{120}$, and because $k$ is an integer, we have $0\\le k \\le 10$. Thus there are 11 possible integer values of $k$. For each such $k$, the corresponding value of $x$ is $\\left(120 - k^2\\right)^2$. Because  $\\left(120 -\nk^2\\right)^2$ is positive and decreasing for $0\\le k \\le 10$, the $\\boxed{11}$ values of $x$ are distinct.",
