Setting $2-|x|$ equal to 1 and to $-1$, we solve \\begin{align*}\n2-|x|=1 \\quad &\\text{or} \\quad 2-|x|=-1 \\\\\n|x|=1 \\quad &\\text{or} \\quad |x|=3 \\\\\nx=\\pm1 \\quad &\\text{or} \\quad x=\\pm3.\n\\end{align*} The sum of the squares of these four solutions is $(-1)^2+1^2+(-3)^2+3^2=\\boxed{20}$.",
