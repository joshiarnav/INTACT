    "problem": "Eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. If seven pens cost $\\$ 9.24$, what is the cost, in cents, of one pencil?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If seven pens costs $\\$9.24$, then each pen costs $\\frac{924}{7}=132$ cents. Now we can multiply ratios to find the cost of one pencil. $$\\frac{11\\text{ pencils}}{3 \\text{ pens}}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ pen}}{132\\text{ cents}}=\\frac{11}{132\\times3}=\\frac{1}{12\\times3}=\\frac{1 \\text{ pencil}}{36 \\text{ cents}}$$ The ratio is $1$ pencil to $36$ cents, so a pencil costs $\\boxed{36}$ cents.",
