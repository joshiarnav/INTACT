    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are trying to find the day of the month on which the pond was $75\\%$ algae-free, or the day when the pond was $25\\%$ covered. On day $30$ of the month the pond was completely covered, and the amount of algae doubled every day. This means that on day $29$, the pond was half covered in algae, and therefore on day $\\boxed{28}$ the pond was $25\\%$ covered in algae.",
