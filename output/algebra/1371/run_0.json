In this case, the equation is x^2 - 13x + 4 = 0, so the sum of the roots is 13/1 = 13.\n\n## Step 2: Write the equation for the sum of the reciprocals of the roots\nLet r_1 and r_2 be the roots of the equation. The sum of the reciprocals of the roots is 1/r_1 + 1/r_2.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Vieta's formulas to find the product of the roots\nAccording to Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is given by c/a. In this case, the equation is x^2 - 13x + 4 = 0, so the product of the roots is 4/1 = 4.\n\n## Step 4: Write the equation for the sum of the reciprocals as a single fraction\nWe can rewrite 1/r_1 +\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction\n$\\frac{r_1 + r_2}{r_1 \\cdot r_2}$\n## Step 6: Substitute the sum and product of the roots into the fraction\n$\\frac{13}{4}$\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction\n$\\frac{13}{4}$\nFinal Answer: $\\frac{13}{4}$",
