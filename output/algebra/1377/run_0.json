    "problem": "A tree is now 12 feet tall and grows 18 inches a year. In how many years will the tree be 36 feet tall?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "From 12 feet to 36 feet, the tree will grow 24 feet.  If it grows at a rate of 1.5 feet per year, then it will take the tree $\\frac{24}{1.5}=\\boxed{16}$ years to reach a height of 36 feet.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "First, we need to convert 12 feet to inches to have the same units as the annual growth rate.\n12 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 144 inches\nThe tree needs to grow 36 - 12 = 24 feet. Converting 24 feet to inches: 24 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 288 inches.\nDivide the total inches the tree needs to grow (288 inches) by the annual growth rate (18 inches/year).\n288 inches \u00f7 18 inches/year = 16 years\nThere is no next step. The solution is complete.\nDivide the total inches the tree needs to grow (288 inches) by the annual growth rate (18 inches/year).",
