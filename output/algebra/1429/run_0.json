    "solution": "First, let $A = $ Addison's age, $B = $ Brenda's age, and $J = $ Janet's age. Then, from the statements given, we have the following system of equations:  $$\\begin{cases}\nA=3B \\\\\nJ = B+6 \\\\\nA=J\n\\end{cases} $$ Since $A=J$, we know that $3B=B+6$. Solving this equation, we have that $2B = 6 \\Rightarrow B=3$. Thus, Brenda is $\\boxed{3}$ years old.",
