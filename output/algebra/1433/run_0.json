    "problem": "Given 40 feet of fencing, what is the greatest possible number of square feet in the area of a rectangular pen enclosed by the fencing?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the perimeter is 40, the sides of the rectangle add up to $40/2 = 20.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $20 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(20 - x) = 20x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 20x = -x^2 + 20x - 100 + 100 = 100 - (x - 10)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{100}$ square feet, which occurs for a $10 \\times 10$ square.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let x be the length of the pen and y be the width of the pen.\nStep 2: The perimeter of the pen is 2x + 2y, and since the total length of fencing is 40 feet, we can set up the equation 2x + 2y = 40.\nStep 3: Solve the equation 2x + 2y = 40 for y to get y = 20 - x.\nStep 4: The area of the pen is x * y, and substituting y = 20 - x into the area equation gives x * (20 - x) = 20x - x^2.\nStep 5: To maximize the area of the pen, we need to find the vertex of the parabola given by the equation 20x - x^2.\nStep 6: Complete the square on the equation 20x - x^2 to get - (x^2 - 20x) = -(x^2 - 20x + 100) + 100 = - (x - 10)^2 + 100.\nStep 7: The vertex form is - (x - 10)^2 + 100, so the vertex of the parabola is at (10, 100), which means the maximum area is 100 square feet.\nStep 8: Since the vertex of the parabola occurs at the point (10, 100), the maximum area of the pen is 100 square feet.\nStep 9: The maximum area occurs when x = 10, so the length of the pen is 10 feet, and the width is y = 20 - x = 20 - 10 = 10 feet.\nStep 10: The dimensions of the pen that maximize the area are 10 feet by 10 feet, which gives an area of 100 square feet.",
