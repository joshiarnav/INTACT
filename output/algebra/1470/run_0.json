    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We tackle this with some careful casework.\n\nCase 1: $x\\ge 2$.  We then have $|x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2| = (x-1) + (x-1.5) + (x-2) = 3x - 4.5$.  Since the smallest value of $x$ in this case is $2$, the smallest possible value of the sum in this case is $3(2) - 4.5 = 1.5$.\n\nCase 2: $1.5\\le x < 2$.  We then have  \\begin{align*}\n|x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2| & = (x-1) + (x-1.5) + (-(x-2)) \\\\\n& = 2x - 2.5 -x+2 \\\\\n& = x -0.5.\n\\end{align*} Since the smallest possible value of $x$ in this case is $1.5$, the smallest possible value of the sum in this case is $1.5-0.5 = 1$.\n\nCase 3: $1 \\le x < 1.5$.  We then have  \\begin{align*}\n|x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2| & = (x-1) - (x-1.5) - (x-2) \\\\\n& = x-1 -x + 1.5-x+2 \\\\\n& = -x +2.5.\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ is less than 1.5, the sum in this case is greater than $-1.5+2.5 = 1$.\n\nCase 4: $x < 1$.  We then have  \\begin{align*}\n|x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2| & = -(x-1) - (x-1.5) - (x-2) \\\\\n& = -3x + 4.5.\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ is less than 1, the sum in this case is greater than $-3(1) + 4.5 = 1.5$.\n\nReviewing these cases, we see that the least possible sum is $\\boxed{1}$.  As an extra challenge, see if you can find a quick solution to this problem by thinking about the graph of $y = | x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2|$.",
