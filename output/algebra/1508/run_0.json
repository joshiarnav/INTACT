    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we multiply the second equation, the reciprocal of the first equation, and the reciprocal of the third equation, we get \\[\\frac{s}{r}\\cdot\\frac{r}{q}\\cdot \\frac{t}{s} = 6\\cdot \\frac{1}{9}\\cdot2\\Rightarrow \\frac{t}{q}= \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}.\\]",
