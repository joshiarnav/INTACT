    "problem": "Six construction workers that work at the same rate can build a house in 1.5 days.  How long does it take 15 construction workers, working at the same rate, to finish building a house?  Express your answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of workers is inversely proportional to the amount of time it takes to build a house.  Thus $$\\text{number of workers} \\times \\text{time} = \\text{constant}.$$Using this, we have that $6 \\cdot 1.5 = 15 \\cdot t \\Rightarrow t = .6$.  As a fraction in lowest terms this is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
