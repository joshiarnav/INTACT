    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the curves $y_1$ and $y_2$ intersect at only one point, then there should be only one solution to the equation $x^2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + b$. To find $b$, we first rearrange the equation to get $x^2 -4x + (7-b) = 0$. This equation has only one solution if and only if the discriminant of $x^2 - 4x + (7 - b) = 0$. Thus, we need  \\begin{align*}\n16 - 4(7-b) &= 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n4b &= 12 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nb &= \\boxed{3}.\n\\end{align*}",
