    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We find the slopes of the two lines and set them equal to each other, since parallel lines have the same slope. This gives $3a+2=\\frac{a}{2}-2$, which implies $a=\\boxed{-\\frac{8}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Since the lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal. Setting the slopes of the given lines equal to each other yields the equation (3a+2)=\\frac{a-4}{2}.\nStep 2: Multiply both sides by $2$ to eliminate the fraction, yielding $2(3a+2)=a-4$.\nStep 3: Expand and simplify the equation to get $6a+4=a-4$.\nSubtract $a$ from both sides to get $5a+4=-4$.\nSubtract $4$ from both sides to get $5a=-8$.\nDivide both sides by $5$ to get $a=-\\frac{8}{5}$.\nDivide both sides by $5$.\nStep 4: Divide both sides by 5 to get $a=-\\frac{8}{5}$.\nStep 5: Final Answer: $a=-\\frac{8}{5}$.",
