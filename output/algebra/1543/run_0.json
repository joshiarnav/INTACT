    "problem": "Angie decided to use her class as a sample to predict the total number of students in her school wearing red on Valentine's Day. She counted 11 students wearing red in her class of 24 students. Using this ratio, how many of the 480 students in her school will she estimate are wearing red?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can use the given information to set up a ratio and solve for the number of kids in the school that are wearing red.  Let $x$ equal the total number of students wearing red in the school.  From the given information, we have$$\\frac{11}{24}=\\frac{x}{480},$$so  $$x=\\frac{480\\cdot 11}{24},$$which means $$x=20\\cdot 11=\\boxed{220}.$$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Set up a proportion to relate the ratio of students wearing red in Angie's class to the ratio of students wearing red in the school. \n9/24 = x/480\nStep 2: Cross-multiply and solve for x: 9 * 480 = 24x, 4320 = 24x, x = 180\nStep 3: Write a sentence using the information found in the previous steps to answer the question. Angie estimates that 180 students in her school will be wearing red.\nStep 4: Check if the final answer makes sense by comparing it to the information in the problem.",
