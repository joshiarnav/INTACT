Therefore, if $f(f(f(x)))=-3$, then $f(f(x))$ equals $-4$ or $0$.\n\nThere are three points on the graph whose $y$-coordinates are $-4$ or $0$. These are $(-2,-4),$ $(-6,0),$ and $(2,0)$. Therefore, if $f(f(x))$ is $-4$ or $0$, then $f(x)$ equals $-2,$ $-6,$ or $2$.\n\nThere are four points on the graph whose $y$-coordinates are $-2$ or $2$ (and none whose $y$-coordinate is $-6$). The $x$-coordinates of these points are not integers, but we can use the symmetry of the graph (with respect to the vertical line $x=-2$) to deduce that if these points are $(x_1,-2),$ $(x_2,-2),$ $(x_3,2),$ and $(x_4,2),$ then $x_1+x_2=-4$ and $x_3+x_4=-4$.
