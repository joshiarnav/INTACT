So, the expression can be factored as a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b), which gives us (6 + 2x)(6 - 2x).\nStep 2: Factor out the greatest common factor of 2 from both terms.\nStep 3: The greatest common factor of 2 can be factored out from both terms to get 2(3 + x)2(3 - x).\nStep 4: Multiply the factors 2(3 + x) and 2(3 - x) to get 4(3 - x^2).\nFinal Answer: \n$4(3-x^2)$",
