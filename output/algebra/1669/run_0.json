    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The amount of tax collected is $\\frac{x}{100} \\cdot 1000x = 10x^2,$ so the take home pay is\n\\[1000x - 10x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1000x - 10x^2 &= -10(x^2 - 100x) \\\\\n&= -10(x^2 - 100x + 2500) + 25000 \\\\\n&= -10(x - 50)^2 + 25000.\n\\end{align*}The maximum take home pay occurs when $x = 50,$ which corresponds to an income of $\\boxed{50000}$ dollars.",
