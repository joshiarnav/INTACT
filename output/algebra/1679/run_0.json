    "problem": "What is the product of the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints at $(2,3)$ and $(-6,5)$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the midpoint of a segment has coordinates that are the average of the endpoints, we see that the midpoint has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{2 - 6}{2}, \\frac{3+5}{2}\\right) = (-2, 4)$.  Thus our desired answer is $-2\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{-8}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: To find the midpoint of a line segment, use the midpoint formula: $(x_m, y_m) = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the endpoints.\nStep 2: The given endpoints are $(2, 3)$ and $(-6, 5)$. Use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of the midpoint: $(x_m, y_m) = \\left(\\frac{2 + (-6)}{2}, \\frac{3 + 5}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 3: Simplify the expressions within the parentheses to obtain the coordinates of the midpoint: $(x_m, y_m) = \\left(\\frac{-4}{2}, \\frac{8}{2}\\right) = (-2, 4)$.\nStep 4: Calculate the product of the coordinates of the midpoint: $(-2) \\times (4) = -8$.\nStep 4: Calculate the product of the coordinates of the midpoint: (-2) \u00d7 (4) = -8.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -8.",
