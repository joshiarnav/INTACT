    "problem": "If $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are both seventh-degree polynomials in $t$, what is the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The $t^7$ terms multiply to a $t^{14}$ term.  All the other terms multiply to terms of lesser degree, so the degree of the product of polynomials is $\\boxed{14}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1:  We are given that $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are both seventh-degree polynomials in $t$.\nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. Since both $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are seventh-degree polynomials, the highest power of $t$ in each polynomial is $7$.\n\nNow we can start solving the problem.\nStep 2:  The degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees.\nThe sum of the degrees of $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ is $7 + 7 = 14.$\nStep 3:  Therefore, the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is $14$.\nStep 4:  The degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is $14$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14.",
