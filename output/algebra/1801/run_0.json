We can find this by solving \\[3-x^2+x^3=1+x^2+x^3.\\]This simplifies to  \\[2(x^2-1)=0.\\]This has two solutions, at $x=1$ and $x=-1$.  The $y$-coordinates for these points are  \\[1+1^2+1^3=3\\]and \\[1+(-1)^2+(-1)^3=1.\\]The difference between these values is $\\boxed{2}$.",

Now, we need to find the minimum value of the expression $2 - 2x^2$, since the difference between the y-coordinates are given by this expression. To find the minimum value, we notice that the expression is a quadratic expression that opens downward, so the minimum value is attained at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is 0, so the minimum value is attained when $x=0$.
