    "problem": "It takes 24 minutes for Jana to walk one mile. At that rate, how far in miles will she walk in 10 minutes? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Using dimensional analysis, we have $\\dfrac{1\\mbox{ mile}}{24\\mbox{ min}} \\times 10\\mbox{ min} = \\dfrac{5}{12}$ miles, or $\\boxed{0.4\\mbox{ miles}}$ to the nearest tenth.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Let x = the distance Jana will walk in 10 minutes. Set up proportion 24 minutes/1 mile = 10 minutes/x miles.\nCross-multiply to get 24x = 10(1).\nDivide both sides by 24 to get x = 10/24.\nDivide both sides by 10 to get x = 10/24 = 0.4167. Rounded to the nearest tenth, x = 0.4.\nSimplify the fraction 10/24 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2, to get 5/12.\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2, to get 5/12.\nDivide 5 by 12 to get x = 5/12 = 0.4167. Rounded to the nearest tenth, x = 0.4.\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2, to get 5/12.",
