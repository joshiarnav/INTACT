    "problem": "Both roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 63 x + k = 0$ are prime numbers. How many possible values of $k$ are there?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $p$ and $q$ be two primes that are roots of $x^2 - 63 x + k = 0$. Then $$\nx^2 - 63 x + k = (x - p)(x - q) = x^2 - (p+q)x + p \\cdot q,\n$$ so $p + q = 63$ and $p\\cdot q=k$. Since $63$ is odd, one of the primes must be $2$ and the other $61$. Thus, there is exactly $\\boxed{1}$ possible value for $k$, namely $k = p\\cdot q = 2\\cdot 61=122$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Recall the relation between the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients. The sum of the roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 63 x + k = 0$ is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the linear term, i.e., $r_1 + r_2 = 63$.\nStep 2: Since the sum of the roots is $63$ and both roots are prime numbers, the roots must be $2$ and $61$, as these are the only two prime numbers that add up to $63$ and satisfy the condition of being prime.\nStep 3: Since the roots are $2$ and $61$, the product of the roots, which is the constant term in the quadratic equation, is $2 \\cdot 61 = 122$. Therefore, there is only one possible value of $k$, which is $122$.\nStep 4: Since there are no other prime numbers that add up to 63, there is only one possible pair of prime roots, and therefore there is only one possible value for k, which is 122.
