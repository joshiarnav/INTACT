    "problem": "Sue can either borrow $10,\\!000$ dollars for $5$ years with a simple interest of $7\\%$ annually or an interest which compounds annually for $6\\%$. How much more money, rounded to the nearest dollar, would she have to pay back for the more expensive interest than the less expensive interest?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "For the simple interest rate, she would have to pay an interest of $10000 \\cdot 0.07=700$ dollars every year. Since there are $5$ years, in the end she would have to pay back $10000+5\\cdot 700=13500$ dollars.\n\nFor the compounded interest, her balance is multiplied by $1+6\\%=1.06$ each year. Therefore, at the end of 5 years her balance is $A=10000(1+0.06)^5=13382.255..$.\n\nThe simple interest rate would be more expensive by $13500-13382.255 \\approx \\boxed{118 \\text{ dollars}}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1:  First, let's determine the amount Sue would have to pay back for each interest option.\nFor the simple interest, the amount Sue would have to pay back can be found by adding the principal to the product of the principal and the annual interest rate times the number of years: $10,000(1+0.07 \\times 5)$.\nFor the compound interest, the amount Sue would have to pay back can be found using the formula $A=P(1+r)^n$, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate and n is the number of years. So, we can compute $10,000(1.06)^5$.\nStep 2: \n$10,000(1+0.07 \\times 5) = 10,000 \\times 1.35 = 13,500$.\n$10,000(1.06)^5 \\approx 10,000 \\times 1.338225577 = 13,382.26$.\n$13,500 - 13,382.26 \\approx 117.74$\nRounded to the nearest dollar, $117.74 \\approx 118$.\nStep 3:\nThe difference between the two amounts is $13,500-13,382.26=118.74$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 119.",
