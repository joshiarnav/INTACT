Also, counting carefully, we can see that when the line travels exactly 7 units horizontally, it travels 4 units vertically.  Therefore, the slope of the line is $4/7$.  So, the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is $y=\\frac{4}{7}x+3$.  Substituting 1001 for $x$ and $n$ for $y$, we can find $n$: \\begin{align*}\nn&=\\frac{4}{7}\\cdot 1001 +3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=4\\cdot 143 +3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=572+3=\\boxed{575}.\n\\end{align*}",
