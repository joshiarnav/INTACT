    "problem": "For a certain species of ocean fish, 8 fish can exist per cubic meter of water without the symptoms of overcrowding. If doctors want to study 600 fish, what is the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary to maintain a healthy study environment?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We need 8 fish per cubic meter.  We have 600 fish, so we have $600/8 = 75$ groups of 8 fish, which means we need $\\boxed{75}$ cubic meters of water.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Divide 600 by 8 to find the number of cubic meters of water.\nRound up to the nearest whole number.\nDivide 600 by 8 to find the number of cubic meters of water.",
