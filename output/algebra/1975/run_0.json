    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The absolute value of the product of two numbers is the product of their absolute values, so we can write  \\[\n|x^2-16|=|(x+4)(x-4)|=|x+4|\\,|x-4|.\n\\]Since $|x^2-16|$ is written as the product of two positive integers, it is composite unless one of the integers is $1$.  Solving $|x+4|=1$, we observe that either $x+4=1$ or $x+4=-1$, which give solutions of $x=-3$ and $x=-5$.  Similarly, solving $|x-4|=1$ we find $x=3$ or $x=5$. Among the possible solutions $\\{-5,-3,3,5\\}$, only $\\{-3,3\\}$ yield a prime value for $|x+4|\\,|x-4|$.  Therefore, the product of the integer values of $x$ for which $|x^2-16|$ is a prime number is $\\boxed{-9}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the values of $x$ for which $|x^2 - 16|$ is a prime number.\nFor $|x^2 - 16|$ to be prime, $x^2 - 16$ must be either a prime number or a negative prime number.\nStep 2:  Since $x^2$ is always non-negative, $x^2 - 16$ is negative for $x^2 < 16$. Therefore, for $|x^2 - 16|$ to be prime, $x^2 - 16$ must be a prime number.\nStep 3:  We can factor $x^2 - 16$ as $(x - 4)(x + 4)$, which can be expressed as $(x - 4)(x - 4)(x + 4)$ or $4(x-4)(x+4)$ or $4(x^2-16)$.\nStep 4:  We now need to find the values of $x$ such that $|x^2 - 16|$ is a prime number. We must consider the cases where $x^2 - 16$ is positive and where it is negative. If $x^2 - 16$ is positive, it means $x^2 \\ge 16$, which gives us $x \\ge 4$ or $x \\le -4$. If $x^2 - 16$ is negative, it means $x^2 < 16$, which gives us $-4 < x < 4$.\nStep 5:  Checking for prime values of $|x^2 - 16|$ for $x \\ge 4$ or $x \\le -4$: Since $x^2 - 16$ is positive, we can simply check for prime values of $x^2 - 16$. We have $x^2 - 16 = 16$ when $x = 4$, and this is not prime. Similarly, $x^2 - 16 = 32$ when $x = 4\\sqrt{2}$, which is not an integer. When $x = 8$, we have $x^2 - 16 = 48$, which is not prime. We can continue checking all other integer values of $x$ for $x \\ge 4$ or $x \\le -4$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$",
