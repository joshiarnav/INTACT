    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, we factor out the constants of the squared terms to get $9(x^2-2x)+9(y^2+4y)=-44$.\n\nTo complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ after the $-2x$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{2}\\right)^2=4$ after the $4y$, giving $9(x-1)^2+9(y+2)^2=-44+9+36=1$. Dividing the equation by $9$ gives $(x-1)^2+(y+2)^2=\\dfrac{1}{9}$, so the center is $\\boxed{(1,-2)}$.",
