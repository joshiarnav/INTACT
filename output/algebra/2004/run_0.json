    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First we begin by solving the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n5a&=-4b+5, \\\\\n3a&=-2b+3.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting two times the second equation from the first equation, we get $5a-2(3a)=-4b+5-2(-2b+3)$, which simplifies to $-a=-1$. So $a=1$ and plugging this into the first equation we obtain $5=-4b+5$. Solving for $b$, we find that $b=0$. Hence $6b=6\\cdot 0=\\boxed{0}$.",
