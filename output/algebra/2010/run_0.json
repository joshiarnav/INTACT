    "solution": "First we bring all the $x$ and $y$ terms to the left, and put all the other terms on the right.  This makes our system \\begin{align*} 3x+2y &=8,\\\\ 6x+4y&= 2a-7. \\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by 2 makes its coefficients of $x$ and $y$ match those of the second equation: \\begin{align*} 6x+4y &=16,\\\\ 6x+4y&= 2a-7. \\end{align*}If $2a-7=16$, these equations will be the same, so the system will have infinitely many solutions. If $2a-7$ does not equal 16, then this system will have no solutions, since $6x+4y$ cannot equal two different numbers.  Solving $2a-7=16$ gives us $a=\\boxed{\\frac{23}{2}}$.",
