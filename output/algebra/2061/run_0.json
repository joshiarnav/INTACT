    "problem": "The quotient of two positive integers is $\\frac{5}{2}$ and their product is 160. What is the value of the larger of the two integers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $2x$ be the smaller integer.  Then the larger integer is $5x$.  The product of the integers is 160, so $(2x)(5x)=160\\implies 10x^2=160 \\implies x^2=16$.  Since $x$ is positive, this implies $x=4$ which in turn implies that the larger integer is $5\\cdot4=\\boxed{20}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let the two positive integers be $x$ and $y$ such that $x>y$ and $\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{5}{2}$.\nStep 2: Since $\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{5}{2}$, we can write $x=5a, y=2a$ for some positive integer $a$.\nStep 3: We are also given that the product of the two integers is 160, so we can write the equation $x\\cdot y=160$ and substitute to obtain $5a\\cdot 2a=160$.\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation from step 3, we have $10a^2=160$.\nStep 5: Dividing both sides by 10, we have $a^2=16$.\nStep 6: Taking the square root of both sides, we have $a=4$.\nStep 7: Since $a=4$, we have $x=5a=5(4)=20$ and $y=2a=2(4)=8$.\nSince $x=5a=5(4)=20$ and $y=2a=2(4)=8$, we have $x>y$.\n\nFinal Answer",
