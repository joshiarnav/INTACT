    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We want to find the sum of the arithmetic series $301 + 303 + \\dots + 499$.\n\nThe common difference is 2, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this arithmetic sequence is $301 + 2(n - 1) = 2n + 299$.  If $2n + 299 = 499$, then $n = 100$, so the number of terms in this sequence is 100.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(301 + 499)/2 \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{40000}$.",

To start, we need to determine the first and last odd integers within this range.\nThe first odd integer is 301, and the last odd integer is 499.\nStep 2:  We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is given by $\\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $l$ is the last term.\n\nNote: The final answer is not required at this stage.",
