    "solution": "The sides of the rectangle are parallel to the axes, so the fourth point must make a vertical line with (5,11) and a horizontal one with (16,-2); this means that the fourth point is (5,-2). The graph of the region inside the equation is a circle with radius 3 and center (5,-2): [asy]\nsize(150);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8pt));\n\nfill(Arc((5,-2),3,0,90)--(5,-2)--cycle,gray);\ndraw(Circle((5,-2),3));\ndraw((5,-2)--(16,-2)--(16,11)---(5,11)--cycle);\n[/asy] Since each angle of a rectangle is $90^{\\circ}$ and the corner coincides with the center of the circle, the rectangle covers exactly a quarter of the circle. The area of the intersection is thus $\\frac14r^2\\pi=\\frac14\\cdot3^2\\pi=\\boxed{\\frac94\\pi}$.",

This is because the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the axes, and the sides are $11$ units long.\nStep 3:  The equation $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 9$ represents a circle with a radius of $3$ units, and its center at $(5, -2)$.\nStep 4:  By observing the graph of the circle and the rectangle, we notice that the rectangle\u2019s corner coincides with the center of the circle, which indicates that the area of intersection is one-fourth of the circle.\nStep 2: The intersection area is one-fourth of the circle, so the intersection area is $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi r^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\pi (3^2)$\nStep 3: $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (3^2) = \\frac{9}{4}\\pi$\nStep 4: $\\frac{9}{4}\\pi$\nStep 5: $\\frac{9}{4}\\pi$\n$\\frac{9}{4}\\pi$\n$\\frac{9}{4}\\pi$",
