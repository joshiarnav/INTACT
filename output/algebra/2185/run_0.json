Angle $ADC$ is a right angle because $\\overline{AD}$ has slope -1 and $\\overline{DC}$ has slope 1, and the two slopes are negative reciprocals. Similarly, the other three angles between sides bounding the shaded region are also right angles. Since $AD=DC$ by symmetry, $ABCD$ is a square. A diagonal of the square is $BD$, which measures 3 units. So a side of the square measures $3/\\sqrt{2}$ units and the area is $(3/\\sqrt{2})^2=\\boxed{4.5}$ square units.",
