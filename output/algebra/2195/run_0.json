The twelfth term is twice as far from the sixth term $(6$ steps$)$ as the sixth term is from the third term $(3$ steps$).$ Therefore, the twelfth term is $2\\cdot 6 = 12$ less than the sixth term, so it is $-1-12=\\boxed{-13}.$",

The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d.$\n## Step 2: Write equations using given information\nSince the third term is 5, we can write the equation $a_1 + 2d = 5.$ Also, since the sixth term is -1, we can write the equation $a_1 + 5d = -1.$\n## Step 3: Solve the system of equations to find the values of $a_1$ and $d$\nWe can subtract the equation $a_1 + 2d = 5$ from the equation $a_1 + 5d = -1$ to eliminate $a_1.$ This gives us $3d = -6.$ Solving for $d$, we get $d = -2.$\n## Step 4: Substitute the value of $d$ into one of the original equations to solve for $a_1$\nWe can substitute $d = -2$ into the equation $a_1 + 2d = 5.$ This gives us $a_1 + 2(-2) = 5.$ Simplifying, we get $a_1 - 4 = 5,$ so $a_1 = 9.$\n## Step 5: Find the twelfth term of the sequence\nThe twelfth term of the sequence is $a_{12} = a_1 + 11d.$ We know that $a_1 = 9$ and $d = -2$, so $a_{12} = 9 + 11(-2).$\n## Step 6: Calculate the twelfth term\n$a_{12} = 9 + 11(-2) = 9 - 22 = -13.$\n## Step 7: Calculate the twelfth term\n$a_{12} = 9 + 11(-2) = 9 - 22 = -13.$\n## Step 8: Calculate the twelfth term\n$a_{12} = 9 - 22 = -13.$\n## Step 9: Calculate the twelfth term\n$a_{12} = 9 - 22 = -13.$\n## Step 10: Calculate the twelfth term\n$a_{12} = 9 - 22 = -13.$",
