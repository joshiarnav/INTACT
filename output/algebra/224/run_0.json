    "problem": "The square root of $t$ is greater than $2$ and less than $3.5$. How many integer values of $t$ satisfy this condition?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have: $2 < \\sqrt{t} < \\frac{7}{2}$ so squaring the inequality (which we can do because all the terms in it are positive) gives us  $4 < t <\\frac{49}{4}=12.25$.  Therefore, $t$ is an integer between 5 and 12 inclusive, which leaves us with $\\boxed{8}$ possible integer values of $t$.",
