    "solution": "The number $f^{-1}(0)$ is the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 0$.  Since the function $f$ is defined piecewise, to find this value, we must consider both cases $x \\le 3$ and $x > 3$.\n\nIf $x \\le 3$ and $f(x) = 0$, then $3 - x = 0$, which leads to $x = 3$.  Note that this value satisfies the condition $x \\le 3$.  If $x > 3$ and $f(x) = 0$, then $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0$.  This equation factors as $-x(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0$, so $x = 0$, $x = 3$, or $x = -1$.  But none of these values satisfies $x > 3$, so the solution is $x = 3$, which means $f^{-1}(0) = 3$.\n\nNow we compute $f^{-1}(6)$, which is the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 6$.\n\nIf $x \\le 3$ and $f(x) = 6$, then $3 - x = 6$, which leads to $x = -3$.  Note that this value satisfies the condition $x \\le 3$.  If $x > 3$ and $f(x) = 6$, then $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6$, or $x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0$.  This equation factors as $(x - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0$, so $x = 2$, $x = \\sqrt{3}$, or $x = -\\sqrt{3}$.  But none of these values satisfies $x > 3$, so the solution is $x = -3$, which means $f^{-1}(6) = -3$.\n\nTherefore, $f^{-1}(0)+f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = \\boxed{0}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(3mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\nimport graph;\n\ndraw((-20,0)--(20,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-20)--(0,20),Arrows(4));\n\nreal f(real x) {return 3-x;}\nreal g(real x) {return -x^3+2x^2+3x;}\n\nreal x;\n\ndraw(graph(f,-15,3),BeginArrow(4));\ndraw(graph(g,3,4),EndArrow(4));\n\nreal eps = 0.2;\n\ndraw((-eps,3)--(eps,3));\ndraw((-eps,0)--(eps,0));\ndraw((-eps,-3)--(eps,-3));\n\ndot(\"$(-3,6)$\",(-3,6),SW);\ndot(\"$(3,0)$\",(3,0),NE);\n\nlabel(\"$f(x)$\",(3,20.5));\nlabel(\"$x$\",(20.5,-1));\n[/asy]",
