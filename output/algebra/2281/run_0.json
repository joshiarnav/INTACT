    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Start by analyzing the function $$G(x) = |x+1|-|x-1|.$$\nSince the absolute value function changes its behavior at the points where its argument equals $0$, we need to consider different intervals for $x$ to handle the cases where $x+1$ and $x-1$ change sign.\nStep 2:  For $x < -1,$ we can simplify the function by noting that both $x+1$ and $x-1$ are negative in this interval. So, we have $G(x) = -(x+1) - (- (x-1)) = -(x+1) + x-1 = -2$.\n\n-2\nStep 3:  Next, we consider the case where $-1\\leq x< 1$. In this interval, $x+1$ is nonnegative and $x-1$ is negative, so $G(x) = x+1-(- (x-1)) = x+1+x-1 = 2x$\nStep 4:  When $x \\geq 1,$ we have both $x+1$ and $x-1$ nonnegative. So, $G(x) = x+1- (x-1) = x+1-x+1 = 2$.\nStep 5:  We now have the function $G(x)$ simplified for different intervals. We can see that for $x<-1$, $G(x)=-2$; for $-1\\leq x<1$, $G(x)=2x$; and for $x\\geq1$, $G(x)=2$. We need to find the range of $G(x)$ by analyzing the behavior of these simplified expressions.\nStep 6:  We can now analyze the range of $G(x)$. For $x<-1$, $G(x)$ is a constant function with a value of $-2$. For $-1\\leq x<1$, we have a linear function $G(x)=2x$ that goes from $-2$ to $2$. For $x\\geq1$, $G(x)$ is a constant function with a value of $2$. Thus, the range of $G(x)$ is the set of all values that $G(x)$ can take for these different intervals.\nStep 7:  We have $-2 \\leq 2x \\leq 2$, which includes the endpoints.\nThis implies that $G(x)$ takes on all values between $-2$ and $2$, inclusive. \nTherefore, the range of $G(x)$ is $[-2, 2]$.\nWe can now analyze the range of $G(x)$.
