    "solution": "Let $f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$ and $g(x) = b_5 x^5 + b_4 x^4 + b_3 x^3 + b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0$.  Then \\begin{align*}\n2f(x) + 4g(x) &= 2 (a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0) \\\\\n& \\qquad + 4 (b_5 x^5 + b_4 x^4 + b_3 x^3 + b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0) \\\\\n&= 4b_5 x^5 + 4b_4 x^4 + (2a_3 + 4b_3) x^3 + (2a_2 + 4b_2) x^2 \\\\\n& \\qquad + (2a_1 + 4b_1) x + (2a_0 + 4b_0).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the degree of $2f(x) + 4g(x)$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
