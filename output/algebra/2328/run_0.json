    "problem": "Adina and Lynn are going rock-climbing and need to rent special shoes. Lynn is normally size 9 and knows that her rock-climbing shoe-size is 42. If Adina is normally size 6, what size rock-climbing shoes should she rent assuming shoe size is directly proportional to rock-climbing shoe size?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be Adina's rock-climbing size.  The ratio of the girl's shoe sizes must be constant: \\[\\frac{\\text{Lynn's size}}{\\text{Adina's size}} = \\frac{9}{6}=\\frac{42}{x},\\]so $9x=42\\cdot 6$, or $x=\\frac{42\\cdot 6}{9}=\\boxed{28}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Set up a proportion to relate Lynn's normal shoe size to her rock-climbing shoe size. \n(6/9) = (x/42)\nStep 2: Cross-multiply to get 6 times 42 = 9 times x, which yields 252 = 9x.\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for x: x = 252 / 9 = 28.\nStep 4: Since Adina's rock-climbing shoe size is directly proportional to Lynn's rock-climbing shoe size, and Lynn's rock-climbing shoe size is 42, Adina's rock-climbing shoe size should be 28 x 6 / 9 = 24 (using the ratio from step 3).\nStep 5: Adina's rock-climbing shoe size should be 28 x 6 / 9 = 24.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 24.",
