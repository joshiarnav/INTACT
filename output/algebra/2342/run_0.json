    "solution": "The polynomial $f(x)+cg(x)$ will have degree 2 exactly when the $x^3$ terms cancel and the $x^2$ terms do not.  The $x^3$ term of $f(x)+cg(x)$ is \\[4x^3+c(-6x^3)=(4-6c)x^3.\\]This is zero when $c=4/6=2/3$.\n\nIf $c=2/3$, the $x^2$ term is  \\[3x^2+c(5x^2)=(3+5\\cdot 2/3)x^2=\\frac{19}{3}x^2\\neq0.\\]Therefore there is only one solution $c=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
