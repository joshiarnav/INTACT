    "problem": "If $\\lfloor{\\sqrt{x}}\\rfloor=6$, how many possible integer values of $x$ are there?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the expression $\\lfloor{\\sqrt{x}}\\rfloor$ stands for the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $x$, the smallest possible value of $x$ that could satisfy the equation is $6^2$, or $36$. The next integer greater than $6$ is $7$, so the smallest integer (greater than $36$) that would not satisfy $\\lfloor{\\sqrt{x}}\\rfloor=6$ must be $7^2$, or $49$. Therefore, any integer that is in the range $36\\le{x}<49$ could be considered a possible integer value of $x$. Since there are 13 numbers in this range, our final solution is $\\boxed{13}$.",
