    "problem": "Connie is starting an exercise program. On June 1, she will do 25 sit-ups. Each day after that, she will increase her number of sit-ups by four. On which date during the month of June will Connie first do more than 100 sit-ups in one day?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "On June $n$th, Connie will do $25 + 4(n-1)$ sit-ups.  In this problem, we are trying to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that \\[25 + 4(n-1) > 100.\\]  Simplifying the inequality yields $25+4n-4>100$, or $4n>79$.  The smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this simplified inequality is $n=20$; hence, Connie will do more than 100 sit-ups in one day on $\\boxed{\\text{June 20}}$.",
