    "solution": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the solutions the the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$. We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively, so $p+q = m/10$ and $pq = 420/10 = 42$. Since $m = 10(p+q)$, we minimize $m$ by minimizing the sum $p+q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are integers and multiply to 42, the possible values of $(p,q)$ are $(1,42),(2,21),(3,14),(6,7),(7,6),(14,3),(21,2),(42,1)$. (Note that if $p$ and $q$ are both negative, then $p+q$ is negative, so $m$ would be negative, which is excluded by the problem.) The sum $p+q$ is minimized when $(p,q) = (6,7)$ or $(7,6)$. In either case, $m = 10(p+q) = 10(6+7) = \\boxed{130}.$",

Applying the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{m \\pm \\sqrt{m^2 - 16800}}{20}$.\nStep 3: We want the solutions to be integers, which means the expression inside the square root, $m^2 - 16800$, must be a perfect square.\nStep 4: Let $m^2 - 16800 = n^2$, where $n$ is an integer. We can then write $m$ as $\\sqrt{16800 + n^2}$, and since $m$ is the smallest positive value, we want to minimize the value of $n$ while ensuring that $m$ is an integer.\nStep 5: We can start by considering the smallest possible values of $n$ and compute the corresponding values of $m$.
