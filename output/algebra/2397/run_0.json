    "problem": "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. Suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved. By how many percent does the minimum error in the measurement of its position increase?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the minimum position error and the momentum error are inversely proportional, halving one doubles the other, or increases it by $\\boxed{100\\%}$.",
    "is_solved": false,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let the original error in the measurement of momentum be p and the original error in the measurement of position be x. Then the original product is px = h / 4 \u03c0, where h is Planck's constant.\nStep 2: If the error in the measurement of the momentum of the particle is halved, the new error in momentum is p/2. The minimum error in the measurement of the position is still at least h / (4\u03c0) divided by the new error in momentum.\nStep 3: The new error in position is at least h / (4\u03c0) divided by the new error in momentum, which is (h / (4\u03c0)) / (p / 2) = (2h / (4\u03c0p)) = (h / (2\u03c0p)). The ratio of the new error in position to the original error in position is (h / (2\u03c0p)) / (h / (4\u03c0)) = 2.\nStep 4: The new error in position is 2 times the original error in position, so the minimum error in the measurement of its position increases by a factor of 2. To find the percent increase, we calculate (2 - 1) / 1 \u00d7 100% = 100%.\nStep 5: To find the percent increase, we calculate ((2 - 1) / 1) \u00d7 100% = (1 / 1) \u00d7 100% = 100%.\nStep 6: The minimum error in the measurement of its position increases by 100%.\nStep 7: The percent increase is 100%.\nStep 8: The minimum error in the measurement of its position increases by 100%.\nStep 9: The percent increase is 100%.\nStep 10: The percent increase is 100%.",
