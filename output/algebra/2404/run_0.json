    "problem": "William runs at a constant speed of 8 miles per hour. Running at this constant speed, it takes William 75 seconds to run from his house to school. How many miles did William run?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "William ran for 75 seconds, which we will have to convert to miles. We know have conversion factors to get from seconds to hours, namely $\\frac{1\\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ seconds}} = 1$ and $\\frac{1\\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = 1$. We are also given William's running speed, so $\\frac{8\\text{ miles}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 1$. Thus, we can find that William ran \\[ 75\\text{ seconds}\\cdot \\frac{1\\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ seconds}} \\cdot \\frac{1\\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} \\cdot \\frac{8\\text{ miles}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}\\text{ miles.}\\]",
