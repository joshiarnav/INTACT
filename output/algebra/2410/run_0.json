    "problem": "What is the degree of the polynomial $(3x^2 +11)^{12}$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The degree of the polynomial is the degree of the highest term.  Since the degree of $3x^2 +11$ is 2 and since $(x^a)^{12} = x^{12a}$ for any positive constant $a$, the answer is $2 \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{24}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Identify the degree of the polynomial inside the parentheses, which is the power of the variable in the term with the highest power of the variable, in this case, $3x^2$ has a degree of 2.\nStep 2: The degree of the polynomial $(3x^2 +11)^{12}$ is the degree of the polynomial inside the parentheses, which is 2, multiplied by the exponent outside the parentheses, which is 12, so the degree is 24.\nStep 3: The degree of the polynomial is 24.\nStep 4: The degree of the polynomial is 24.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 24.",
