    "problem": "How many four-digit numbers $N$ have the property that the three-digit number obtained by removing the leftmost digit is one ninth of $N$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $a$ denote the leftmost digit of $N$ and let $x$ denote the three-digit number obtained by removing $a$. Then $N=1000a+x=9x$ and it follows that $1000a=8x$. Dividing both sides by 8 yields $125a=x$. All the values of $a$ in the range 1 to 7 result in three-digit numbers, hence there are $\\boxed{7}$ values for $N$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let $a$ be the leftmost digit of $N$. Then $N=1000a+b$ for some three-digit number $b$.\nStep 2: Since the number obtained by removing the leftmost digit is one-ninth of $N$, then $N/9$ is equal to $b$.\n \nFinal Answer.",
