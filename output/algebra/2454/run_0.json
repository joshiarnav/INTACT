    "problem": "Four people can paint a house in six hours. How many hours would it take three people to paint the same house, assuming everyone works at the same rate?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of people painting the house and the amount of time it takes are inversely proportional. This means that if we let $n$ be the number of people, and $t$ be the time taken, the product $nt$ is a constant. Since 4 people can paint the house in 6 hours, $nt=(4)(6)=24$. Therefore, if three people were painting the same house, $nt=3t=24$, and $t=\\boxed{8}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let x be the number of hours it would take three people to paint the house.\n\nFour people can paint a house in six hours, so the rate of one person is 1/24 of the house per hour (4 people * 6 hours = 24 hours for one person).\n\nThree people can paint a house in x hours, so the rate of three people is 1/x of the house per hour.\n\nSince they all work at the same rate, the rate of one person is equal to the rate of three people: 1/24 = 1/x\nCross multiply to get 1x = 24.\nDivide both sides by 1 to get x = 24.\nDivide both sides by 24 to get x = 24/24, which simplifies to x = 1.\nDivide both sides by 24 to get x = 1/24.\nCross multiply to get 3x = 24.\nDivide both sides by 3 to get x = 24/3.\nDivide both sides by 3 to get x = 8.\nSince they all work at the same rate, the rate of one person is equal to the rate of three people: 1/24 = 1/x\n\n Final Answer: The final answer is: 8",
