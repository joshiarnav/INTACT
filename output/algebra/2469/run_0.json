    "problem": "The amount of money a certain company has can be modeled with the line $y=-265x+2800$, where $x$ is the number of workers the company decides to hire. What is the maximum number of workers the company can hire before the company has no money left and goes bankrupt?",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The point at which the company goes bankrupt is where $y=0$, the $x$-intercept. To solve for the $x$-intercept, we set $y=0$ and get \\begin{align*}\n0 &=-265x+2800\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -2800&=-265x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{2800}{265} &= x.\n\\end{align*} Realizing that $\\frac{2800}{265}$ is between 10, or $\\frac{2650}{265}$, and 11, or $\\frac{2915}{265}$, then the company can hire at most $\\boxed{10}$ workers, since hiring 11 would bring it past the $x$-intercept and into debt.",
