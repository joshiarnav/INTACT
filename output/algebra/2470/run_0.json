    "problem": "At 50 miles per hour, how far would a car travel in $2\\frac{3}{4}$ hours? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In two hours, a car traveling at $50$ mph would travel $50$ mph $\\times 2$ hours $= 100$ miles. Now we find how far a car can travel in $3/4$ of an hour which is $50$ mph $\\times \\frac{3}{4}$ hours $ = \\frac{150}{4} = 37 \\frac{1}{2}$ miles. Thus, the car would travel a total of $100 + 37 \\frac{1}{2}= \\boxed{137 \\frac{1}{2}}$ miles.",
