    "solution": "If $(x,y)$ lies on the circle, so does $(x,-y),$ $(-x,-y),$ and $(-x,-y),$ (which all give the same value of $|x| + |y|$), so we can assume that $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0.$\n\nThen $|x| + |y| = x + y.$  Squaring, we get\n\\[(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1 + 2xy.\\]Note that $(x - y)^2 \\ge 0.$  Expanding, we get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \\ge 0,$ so $2xy \\le x^2 + y^2 = 1.$  Hence,\n\\[1 + 2xy \\le 2,\\]which means $x + y \\le \\sqrt{2}.$  Equality occurs when $x = y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},$ so the maximum value of $|x| + |y|$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}.$",
