    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "For $q(x)$ to be defined, the quantities under both radicals must be nonnegative, and the denominator must be nonzero. Thus we must have $x\\ge 0$ and $1-x^2>0$. The solution to the second inequality is $|x|<1$, so both inequalities are satisfied precisely when $x$ is in the interval $\\boxed{[0,1)}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the domain of the real-valued function $q(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$.\nThe domain of a function is the set of all possible input values for which the function is defined, and it is essential to ensure that the function is real-valued, meaning its output is a real number.\nIn the given function, we have square roots in the numerator and denominator, so we need to consider the restrictions imposed by these square roots.\nThe expression inside each square root must be non-negative, and the denominator cannot be zero.\nLet's start by considering the restrictions imposed by the square roots.\nStep 2:  The numerator $\\sqrt{x}$ requires $x \\ge 0$, while the denominator $\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ requires $1-x^2 \\ge 0$ because the square root of a negative number is not real.\nThis leads to $-1 \\le x \\le 1$ for $1-x^2 \\ge 0$.\nStep 3:  In addition to the restrictions imposed by the square roots, we also need to ensure that the denominator is not equal to zero. This means $1 - x^2 > 0$, as division by zero is undefined. Solving $1 - x^2 > 0$ yields $x^2 < 1$.\nStep 4:  Since $x^2 < 1$ is equivalent to $-1 < x < 1$, we can combine this with $0 \\le x$ from the square root in the numerator, and $-1 \\le x \\le 1$ from the square root in the denominator.\nStep 5:  The combined interval for the domain is $0 \\le x < 1$.\nStep 6:  The final answer is: $\\boxed{(0,1]}$",
