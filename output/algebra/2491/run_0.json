Let's divide the fourth term by the third term: r = 64/32 = 2.\n\n## Step 2: Use the common ratio to express the relationship between the first three terms and the first term.\nLet the first term be a. Since it is a geometric sequence, the terms are related by the common ratio (r = 2). Therefore, b = 2a, c = 2b = 2(2a) = 2^2a = 4a, and so on.\n\n## Step 3: Use the given terms to set up an equation to solve for the first term.\nGiven the sequence is a, b, c, 32, 64, we know c = 32 and 64 = 32 * 2. We can use the relationship between c and a to set up an equation: 4a = 32.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation from step 3 for the first term.\nDivide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for a: a\na = 32/4 = 8\n## Step 5: a\n= 8\n## Step 6: a = 8\n## Step 7: a = 8\na = 8\n## Step 8: a = 8\n## Step 9: a = 8\n## Step 10: a = 8\n## Step 11: a = 8",
