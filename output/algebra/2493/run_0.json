    "problem": "Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age. If Andrew's grandfather was 56 years old when Andrew was born, how many years old is Andrew now?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be Andrew's age now and $g$ be his grandfather's age now. We are looking for the value of $a$. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information, as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ng &= 8a \\\\\ng-a &= 56 \\\\\n\\end{align*}In particular, the second equation represents the grandfather's age $a$ years ago, when Andrew was born. To solve for $a$, we need to eliminate $g$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $g$, we get that $8a-a=56$ or $a=8$. Thus, Andrew is $\\boxed{8}$ years old now.",
