    "problem": "Anthony made $5$ of his first $12$ free throw attempts. If he makes $2/3$ of his next $24$ attempts, by how many percentage points will he increase his overall success rate percentage? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If Anthony makes $2/3$ of his next $24$ attempts, he will make another $16$ free throws. Then he will have $5 + 16 = 21$ successful throws in $12 + 24 = 36$ attempts. That's a success rate of $21/36 = 7/12$, which is $58.3\\%$. His success rate before was $5/12$, which is $41.6\\%$. The increase is $58.3 - 41.6 = 16.7$, or $\\boxed{17\\%}$ to the nearest whole number.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let $x$ be Anthony's overall success rate percentage after making $2/3$ of his next $24$ attempts.\nStep 2: Since he made $5$ out of his first $12$ attempts, he made $5$ out of $36$ total attempts after making $2/3$ of his next $24$ attempts.\nStep 3: First, we need to calculate the total number of free throws he made in his next 24 attempts, which is $24\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 16$. Therefore the total number of free throws he made is $5+16 = 21$ out of $36$ total attempts. The overall success rate percentage is $\\frac{21}{36} = \\frac{7}{12} = 58.333...$.\nStep 4:\nHe made 21 out of 36 shots, so his overall success rate percentage is $\\frac{21}{36} = \\frac{7}{12} = 58.333...$. Anthony's success rate before his next 24 attempts was $5$ out of $12$, which is $\\frac{5}{12} = 41.666...$.\nThe difference in success rate percentages is $58.333... - 41.666... = 16.666...$. Rounded to the nearest whole number, this is $17$.\nStep 5: The difference in success rate percentages is $58.\\overline{3} - 41.\\overline{6} = 16.\\overline{7}$. Rounded to the nearest whole number, this is $17$.\nStep 6: The difference in success rate percentages is $58.\\overline{3} - 41.\\overline{6} = 16.\\overline{7}$. Rounded to the nearest whole number, this is $17$.\nThe difference in success rate percentages is $58.\\overline{3} - 41.\\overline{6} = 16.\\overline{7}$.\nStep 7: Final Answer: The final answer is 17.",
