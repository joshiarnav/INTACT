    "solution": "Let $c$ equal the cost of a bouquet of 39 roses (in dollars). Since we know that the price of a bouquet is directly proportional to the number of roses it contains, we can set up the following proportion \\begin{align*} \\frac{c}{39}&=\\frac{20}{12}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad c&=\\left(\\frac{20}{12}\\right)(39)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad c&=\\boxed{65}\n\\end{align*}",
