    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \\boxed{48}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Square the equation $x + 2y = 4$ to obtain $(x + 2y)^2 = 16$, which expands to $x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 = 16$.\nStep 2: Subtract $16xy$ from both sides of the equation $x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 = 16$ to obtain $x^2 + 4y^2 = 16 - 16xy$.\nStep 3: Substitute the value of $xy$ into the expression $16 - 16xy$ to obtain $16 - 16(-8)$.\n\nFinal Answer",
