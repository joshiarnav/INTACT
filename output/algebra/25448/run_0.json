    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The quadratic factors as $(2x + 3)(x - 4 + x - 6) = (2x + 3)(2x - 10) = 2(2x + 3)(x - 5).$  Thus, the roots are $-\\frac{3}{2}$ and 5, and their sum is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}.$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Expand and simplify the equation $(2x+3)(x-4)+(2x+3)(x-6)=0$.\n\nThe equation becomes $2x^2-5x-12+2x^2-9x-18=0$.\nStep 2: Simplify the equation by combining like terms: $4x^2-14x-30=0$.\nStep 3: Use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots. The sum of the roots is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the $x$ term divided by the leading coefficient. In this case, the sum of the roots is $\\frac{-(-14)}{4}=\\frac{14}{4}=\\frac{7}{2}$.\nStep 4: \nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}$",
