    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "A point lies above $y=2x+7$ if its $y$-coordinate is greater than 2 times its $x$-coordinate plus 7.  Checking the given points, we find that $(6,20)$, $(12,35)$, and $(20,50)$ satisfy this condition.  The sum of the $x$-coordinates of these points is $6+12+20=\\boxed{38}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Evaluate the equation of the line y = 2x + 7 for each given x-coordinate to determine the corresponding y-coordinate that would place the point on the line, and compare it to the given y-coordinate to determine if the point lies above or below the line.\nStep 2: For the point (3, 10), the corresponding y-coordinate on the line y = 2x + 7 is 2(3) + 7 = 13. Since 10 < 13, the point (3, 10) lies below the line.\nStep 2: For the point (6, 20), the corresponding y-coordinate on the line y = 2x + 7 is 2(6) + 7 = 19. Since 20 > 19, the point (6, 20) lies above the line.\nStep 3: For the point (12, 35), the corresponding y-coordinate on the line y = 2x + 7 is 2(12) + 7 = 31. Since 35 > 31, the point (12, 35) lies above the line.\nStep 4: For the point (18, 40), the corresponding y-coordinate on the line y = 2x + 7 is 2(18) + 7 = 43. Since 40 < 43, the point (18, 40) lies below the line.\nStep 5: For the point (20, 50), the corresponding y-coordinate on the line y = 2x + 7 is 2(20) + 7 = 47.

Now sum their x-coordinates: 6 + 12 + 20 = 38.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 38.",
