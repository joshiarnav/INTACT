    "solution": "We need to calculate the total purchase price that Susan paid and that Pam paid.\n\nSusan bought $4$ tickets with $25\\%$ discount: $$4 \\times \\$20 = \\$80.$$With a $25$ percent discount, she paid $\\$80 * .75 = \\$60.$\n\nPam bought $5$ tickets with a $30\\%$ discount: $$5 \\times \\$20 = \\$100$$With a $30$ percent discount, she paid $\\$100 * .70 = \\$70.$\n\nThus Pam paid $\\$70 - \\$60 = \\$\\boxed{10}$ more than Susan.",
