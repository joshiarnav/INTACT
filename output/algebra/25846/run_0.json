    "problem": "How many positive whole numbers have cube roots that are less than $10$? For example, $20$ would count since $\\sqrt[3]{20}<10.$",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The cube root of 1000 is 10; the cube root of any number smaller than 1000 is less than 10.  So, the whole numbers from 1 to 999 are the only positive whole numbers with cube roots less than 10.  There are $\\boxed{999}$ such numbers.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: We are looking for the number of positive whole numbers whose cube roots are less than 10.\nStep 2: The cube root of a number n can be written as $\\sqrt[3]{n}$. Using this expression, we can say that a number n has a cube root less than 10 if $10>\\sqrt[3]{n}$.\nStep 3: We can cube both sides of the inequality to get $10^3 > n$.\nStep 4:  $10^3 = 1000$, so we want to find the number of positive whole numbers less than $1000$.\nStep 5: There are 999 positive whole numbers less than 1000.\nSince there are 999 positive whole numbers less than 1000, the answer is 999. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 999.",
