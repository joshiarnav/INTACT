    "problem": "If $c$ is a constant such that $x^2+100x+c$ is equal to the square of a binomial, then what is $c$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If $x^2+100x+c$ is the square of a binomial, then because the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$, the binomial must be of the form $x+a$ for some $a$.\n\nExpanding, we have $(x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$. For this to be equal to $x^2+100x+c$, the coefficients of $x$ must agree, so $2a$ must be equal to $100$. This gives $a=50$, and so the constant term $a^2$ is $\\boxed{2500}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: The expression $x^2+100x+c$ can be written as $(x+a)^2$ for some constant $a$. Therefore, we can expand the expression $(x+a)^2$ to obtain $x^2+2ax+a^2$ and then compare this to $x^2+100x+c$ to determine the values of $a$ and $c$.\nStep 2: $2ax = 100x \\Rightarrow a = 50$\nStep 3: Since $a = 50$, then $a^2 = 50^2 \\Rightarrow a^2 = 2500$. Comparing this to $x^2 + 100x + c$, we have $c = a^2 = 2500$.\nStep 4: $a^2 = 2500 = c$\nStep 5: Since $(x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$, then $c = a^2$.\nStep 6: Therefore, $c = 2500$. Final Answer",
