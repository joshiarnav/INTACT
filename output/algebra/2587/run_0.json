    "problem": "The $XYZ$ company has to pay $\\$5,000$ for rent each month. In addition, their monthly electricity bill is$ \\$1.45$ per kilowatt-hour of electricity used. If the total cost for both rent and electricity in January was $\\$16,520.25$, how many kilowatt-hours of electricity did they use?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If $x$ is the number of kilowatt-hours of power that the company used in January, then the company paid $5000+1.45x$ dollars for that month.  Setting $5000+1.45x=16520.25,$ we find $x=(16520.25-5000)/1.45=\\boxed{7945}$.",
