    "solution": "Let $f(x) = a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$ and $g(x) = b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0$.  Then \\begin{align*}\n&\\ \\ \\ \\ f(x) - g(x) \\\\&= (a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0) - (b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0) \\\\\n&= a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + (a_2 - b_2) x^2 + (a_1 - b_1) x + (a_0 - b_0).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the degree of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: The degree of a polynomial is determined by the highest degree of the individual terms it contains.\nStep 2: Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4 and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, the highest degree term in $f(x)$ will be of degree 4 and the highest degree term in $g(x)$ will be of degree 2. Thus, the highest degree term in $f(x) - g(x)$ will be the difference of the highest degree terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\nStep 3: The difference of the highest degree terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ will be of degree 4, because the difference of terms of the same degree has the same degree.\nStep 4: The degree of the polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$ is therefore 4.\nStep 5: Therefore, the degree of the polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$ is 4.\nStep 6: Therefore, the degree of the polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$ is 4.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
