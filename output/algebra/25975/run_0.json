    "problem": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The minimum possible degree is $0$, since we can find polynomials such that $f(x) = -g(x)+c,$ where $c$ is some nonzero constant. This gives us $f(x) + g(x)=c,$ which has degree $0$. Since we are looking for the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees, we can easily see that our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$\n\nNote: The maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is $7,$ since it is impossible for a sum of two polynomials of degree $7$ to include any terms of degree higher than $7.$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 7, we can express them as $f(x) = a_7x^7 + a_6x^6 + \\dots + a_0$ and $g(x) = b_7x^7 + b_6x^6 + \\dots + b_0$ for some constants $a_i$ and $b_i$.\nStep 2:  To find the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$, we need to consider the maximum power of $x$ in the sum of the two polynomials. This can occur in several ways: \n- The maximum power of $x$ can come from the $x^7$ terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, in which case the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ will be 7.\n- The maximum power of $x$ can come from the sum of the $x^7$ terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, as well as the $x^6$ terms of $f(x)$ or $g(x)$, in which case the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ will be 8.\n- Similarly, the maximum power of $x$ can come from the sum of the $x^7$ terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, as well as the $x^6$ terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, in which case the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ will also be 8.\nStep 3:  Therefore, the minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7, and the maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 8.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$",
