    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "There are two ways for $x$ to not be in the domain of $g$: it can not be in the domain of $f$, or it can be in the domain of $f$ but not in the domain of $f\\circ f$.  In the first case, the denominator of $f$ is zero, so\n$$x-3=0\\Rightarrow x=3.$$For the second case, we see that the denominator of $f(f(x))$ is $\\frac{1}{x-3}-3$.  If this is zero, we have \\[\\frac{1}{x-3} = 3 \\implies x-3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies x = 3+\\frac13 = \\frac{10}3.\\]This is greater than $3$, so the largest $x$ not in the domain of $g$ is $\\boxed{\\tfrac{10}{3}}$.",
