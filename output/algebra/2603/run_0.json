    "problem": "Let $x$ be a value such that $9x^2 - 18x - 16 = 0$ and $15x^2 + 28x + 12 = 0.$ What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a simplified common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We solve each equation separately. First off, we have $9x^2 - 18x - 16 = (3x+2)(3x-8) = 0.$ We can also see that $15x^2+28x+12 = (3x+2)(5x+6) = 0.$ It is clear that both equations are satisfied only when $3x + 2 = 0,$ therefore $x = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{2}{3}}.$",
