To satisfy the middle square root, we must have  $$2-\\sqrt{x}\\geq 0\\Rightarrow 4\\geq x.$$ Finally, the outermost square root requires $$1-\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{x}}\\geq 0.$$ This gives us $$1\\geq 2-\\sqrt{x}\\Rightarrow x\\geq 1.$$ Combining our inequalities, we get ${1\\leq x\\leq 4}$, or $x \\in \\boxed{[1, 4]}$ in interval notation.",
