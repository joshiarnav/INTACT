    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If Tom can mow a lawn in $5$ hours, then in one hour, he can mow $1/5$ of the lawn. Since he mows for $2$ hours, he finished mowing $2 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$ of the lawn. This leaves $1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$ of the lawn left to be mowed.",
