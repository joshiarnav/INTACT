    "solution": "To start, we can find the $y$-intercept of each of these lines.  Using this, we can calculate the length of that side of the triangle, and use it as a base.  Letting $x=0$ in the first equation gives $y=-2$ as a $y$-intercept.  Letting $x=0$ in the second equation gives $3y=12\\Rightarrow y=4$ as a $y$-intercept.  Therefore, the triangle has a length of $4-(-2)=6$ on the $y$-axis.\n\nThe height of the triangle will be equal to the $x$-coordinate of the intersection of the two lines.  So, we need to solve for $x$ in the system: \\begin{align*}\ny-3x&=-2\\\\\n3y+x&=12\n\\end{align*}Multiply the first equation by 3, then subtract the second equation as shown: \\begin{tabular}{ r c c c l}\n$3y$&-&$9x$&=&-6\\\\\n-($3y$&+&$x$&=&12)\\\\ \\hline\n&-&$10x$&=&-18\\\\\n\\end{tabular}Therefore, $x=\\frac{18}{10}=\\frac{9}{5}$.  This is equal to the height of the triangle.  The area will be $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{9}{5}\\cdot 6=\\boxed{\\frac{27}{5}}$",

This involves finding the points of intersection of the lines with the $y$-axis and with each other.\nStep 2:  First, we find the points of intersection with the $y$-axis by setting $x=0$ in each equation.\nStep 3:  For the first line, we have $y-3(0)=-2$, which simplifies to $y=-2$. So, the point of intersection with the $y$-axis is $(0,-2)$.\nStep 4:  For the second line, we have $3y+0=12$, which simplifies to $y=4$. So, the point of intersection with the $y$-axis is $(0,4)$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the point of intersection of the two lines. To do this, we can solve the system of equations formed by the lines.\nStep 2: To find the point of intersection of the two lines, we solve the system of equations given by $y-3x=-2$ and $3y+x=12$. We can solve one of the equations for $y$ and substitute that expression into the other equation. Let's solve the first equation for $y$: $y=3x-2$. Substituting this expression for $y$ into the second equation, we get $3(3x-2)+x=12$. Solving for $x$, we have $9x-6+x=12$, which simplifies to $10x=18$, giving $x=\\frac{18}{10}=\\frac{9}{5}$. Substituting this value of $x$ into the expression for $y$ gives $y=3\\left(\\frac{9}{5}\\right)-2=\\frac{27}{5}-2=\\frac{27}{5}-\\frac{10}{5}=\\frac{17}{5}$. Therefore, the point of intersection of the two lines is $\\left(\\frac{9}{5}, \\frac{17}{5}\\right)$.\nStep 3: Find the length of the base of the triangle, which is the distance between the points $(0,-2)$ and $(0,4)$. This is a vertical line, so the length is the absolute value of the difference between the $y$-coordinates, which is $|4-(-2)|=|4+2|=6$.\nTo find the area of the triangle, we need to find the length of the altitude from the point of intersection to the line $y=-2$.\n\nHowever, this problem can be solved using the fact that the area of a triangle is half the product of the base and height, so we can use the length of the base and the distance between the point of intersection and the line $y=-2$ to calculate the area.\n\nThe next step is to find the length of the altitude from the point of intersection to the line $y=-2$.\nDraw a line from the point of intersection $\\left(\\frac{9}{5}, \\frac{17}{5}\\right)$ to the line $y=-2$ and find the length of this line, which is the height of the triangle.\nFind the length of the altitude from the point of intersection to the line $y=-2$.\nThe altitude from the point of intersection to the line y=-2 is the absolute value of the difference between the y-coordinate of the point of intersection, which is \\frac{17}{5}, and the y-coordinate of the line, which is -2.
