    "problem": "In a rectangular coordinate system, what is the number of units in the distance from the origin to the point (7, -24)?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula: $$\\sqrt{(7-0)^2 + ((-24)-0)^2} = \\sqrt{49+ 576} = \\sqrt{625} = \\boxed{25}.$$- OR -\n\nNote that the origin, the point $(7, -24)$, and the point $(7, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 7 and 24. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the length of the hypotenuse is $\\boxed{25}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Use the distance formula, which is based on the Pythagorean theorem: d = \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2), where (x1, y1) is the origin (0,0) and (x2, y2) is the given point (7, -24).\nStep 2: Plug in the values into the distance formula: d = \u221a((7 - 0)\u00b2 + (-24 - 0)\u00b2)\nd = \u221a(7\u00b2 + (-24)\u00b2)\n= \u221a(49 + 576)\nd = \u221a(625)\nStep 3: Simplify the square root: d = \u221a(625) = 25\nStep 4: No further steps are needed; the solution is complete.
