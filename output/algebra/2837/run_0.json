    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let's name the two numbers $a$ and $b.$ We want the probability that $ab>a+b,$ or $(a-1)(b-1)>1$ using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick. This inequality is satisfied if and only if $a\\neq 1$ or $b\\neq 1$ or $a \\neq 2 \\neq b$.  There are a total of $16$ combinations such that $a \\neq 1$ and $b \\neq 1$.  Then, we subtract one to account for $(2,2)$, which yields $15$ total combinations out of a total of 25, for a probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$",
