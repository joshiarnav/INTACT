    "problem": "What is the range of the function $$f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Every real number can be expressed in the form $1-x$ for some real $x$, and every real number except $0$ can be expressed as the reciprocal of some real number. Therefore, the range of $f(x)=\\frac{1}{1-x}$ consists of all real numbers except $0$. In interval notation, this is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0)\\cup (0,\\infty)}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Recognize that the function f(x) = 1/(1 - x) is a rational function, and the denominator of the function cannot equal 0, which occurs when 1 - x = 0, or x = 1.\nStep 2: Determine the behavior of the function as x approaches 1 from the left and right.\nStep 3: Since the denominator is 1 - x and x can approach 1 from the left, the function approaches negative infinity. As x approaches 1 from the right, the function approaches positive infinity.\nStep 4: The function is undefined at x = 1, and as x approaches 1, the function approaches positive and negative infinity. Therefore, the range is all real numbers except 0.\n\nFinal Answer.",
