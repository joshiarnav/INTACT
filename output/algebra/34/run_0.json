    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the numbers be $x$ and $y$.  We have $x+y=31$ and $x-y=3$.  Summing these equations, we get $2x=34$, or $x=17$.  Since $x-y$ is positive, this is the larger number, so the answer is $\\boxed{17}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let x be the larger number and y be the smaller number. We have two equations:\nx - y = 3\nx + y = 31\nAdd the two equations together to get 2x = 34.\nDivide by 2 to get x = 17.\nSubstitute x = 17 into x + y = 31 to get 17 + y = 31.\nSubtract 17 from both sides of the equation 17 + y = 31 to get y = 14.\nThe next step is: Final Answer: The final answer is 17.",
