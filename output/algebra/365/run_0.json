    "problem": "Note that $9^2 = 81$, which contains no zeros; $99^2 = 9801$, which contains 1 zero; and $999^2 = 998,\\!001$, which contains 2 zeros. Assuming this pattern continues, how many zeros are in the expansion of $99,\\!999,\\!999^2$?",

    "solution": "The pattern suggests that for a number with $n$ nines, that number squared has $n-1$ zeros. Thus, $99,\\!999,\\!999^2$ should have $8-1=7$ zeros. To prove this, we note that $99,\\!999,\\!999=10^8-1$, so $99,\\!999,\\!999^2=(10^8-1)^2=10^{16}-2\\cdot10^8+1$. Consider this last expression one term at a time. The first term, $10^{16}$, creates a number with 16 zeros and a one at the front. The second term, $2\\cdot10^8$, is a number with 8 zeros and a two at the front. The latter number is subtracted from the former one, so what is left is a string of 7 nines, then an eight, then 8 zeros. Finally, the last term changes the last zero of the number to a one. Thus, we are left with $\\boxed{7}$ zeros.",
