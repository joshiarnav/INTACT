    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If $n$ is the second integer, then the first integer is $n-1$ and the third integer is $n+1$.  The sum of the first and third integers is $2n$, so $n=118/2=\\boxed{59}$.",

The sum of the first and third of three consecutive integers is x + (x + 2).\nSet x + (x + 2) equal to 118.\nCombine like terms to get 2x + 2 = 118.\nSubtract 2 from both sides to get 2x = 116.\nDivide both sides by 2 to get x = 58.\nFind the value of the second integer by adding 1 to x. Second integer = x + 1.\nSecond integer = x + 1 = 58 + 1 = 59\nSecond integer = x + 1 = 58 + 1 = 59",
