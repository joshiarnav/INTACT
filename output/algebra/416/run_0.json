    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Cross-multiplying gives $(x+2)(x+1) = 12$.  Expanding the left side gives $x^2 + 3x + 2 = 12$, so $x^2 + 3x - 10 = 0$.  Factoring the left side gives $(x+5)(x-2) = 0$, so the least solution for $x$ is $x = \\boxed{-5}$.",

This gives $x=-5$ or $x=2$.\nStep 6: Check which value of $x$ is the least.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $x = -5$.",
