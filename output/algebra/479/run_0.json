    "problem": "For two real values of $n$, the equation $4x^2+nx+25=0$ has exactly one solution in $x$. What is the positive value of $n$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "A quadratic has exactly one distinct solution when its discriminant is 0.  The discriminant of $4x^2 + nx + 25$ is $n^2 - 4(4)(25)$.  Setting this equal to 0 gives $n^2 - 400 = 0$, so $n^2 = 400$.  The positive solution of this equation is $n = \\boxed{20}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Recall that a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ has exactly one solution when the discriminant, $b^2-4ac$, is equal to 0.\nStep 2: Set up the equation by substituting $a=4$, $b=n$, and $c=25$ into $b^2-4ac=0$.\nStep 3: Simplify the equation $n^2-4(4)(25)=0$ to $n^2-400=0$.\nStep 4: Solve the equation $n^2-400=0$ for $n$.\nStep 5: Factor the equation $n^2-400=0$ as $(n-20)(n+20)=0$.\nStep 6: Use the Zero Product Property to find the possible values of $n$: $n-20=0$ or $n+20=0$.\nSolve the system of linear equations $n-20=0$ or $n+20=0$ to obtain the values $n=20$ or $n=-20$.\nSince both $n=20$ and $n=-20$ are obtained from the previous step, we need to check which of these values of $n$ makes the original equation have exactly one solution.
