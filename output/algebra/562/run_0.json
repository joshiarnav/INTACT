    "solution": "We factor the quadratic, getting $(a-7)(a-3) \\le 0$. The expression is equal to $0$ when $a=7 \\text{ or } 3$. When $a \\le 3$ or $a \\ge 7$, the quadratic is positive, since the two factors have the same sign. When $3 \\le a \\le 7$, the quadratic is non-positive. Therefore, $a=\\boxed{7}$ is the greatest value of $a$ for which $a^2 - 10a + 21\\le 0$.",

So, we have $a - 7 = 0$ and $a - 3 = 0$, which give us $a = 7$ and $a = 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Create a sign chart to test the intervals between the critical points.\nThe intervals are $(-\\infty, 3)$, $(3, 7)$, and $(7, \\infty)$. Testing a value from each interval into the factored expression will reveal where\n## Step 5: Determine the sign of each factor in each interval and solve the inequality.\nIn $(-\\infty, 3)$, both $(a - 7)$ and $(a - 3)$ are negative, so their product is positive.\nIn $(3, 7)$, $(a - 7)$ is negative and $(a - 3)$ is positive, so their product is negative.\nIn $(7, \\infty)$, both $(a - 7)$ and $(a - 3)$ are positive, so their product is positive.\nSince we are looking for the values of $a$ for which the product is less than or equal to zero, the solution set includes only the interval $(3, 7)$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the greatest value of $a$ within the interval $(3, 7)$.\nSince the interval is open at $7$, the greatest value of $a$ within this interval is $7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
