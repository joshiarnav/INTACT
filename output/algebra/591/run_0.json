    "solution": "We look for the least number of years $n$ it takes for the savings to be greater than or equal to the costs. \\begin{align*}\n1200n&\\ge10,000+650n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n550n&\\ge10,000\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn&\\ge\\frac{10,000}{550}=18.\\overline{18}\n\\end{align*}The smallest integer greater than $18.\\overline{18}$ is 19, so it will take $\\boxed{19}$ years to recuperate the costs.",
