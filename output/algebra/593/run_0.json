    "problem": "A shirt regularly priced at $\\$30$ is on sale for $20\\%$ off. Mary has a coupon that will take another $25\\%$ off of the sale price. What single percent discount would give the same final price as the two successive discounts?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Applying a $20\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $1-20\\%=1-0.2=\\frac{4}{5}$.  Similarly, applying a $25\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{3}{4}$.  Applying both discounts, we multiply by $\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{3}{5}=0.6$.  Since $1-0.6=0.4=40\\%$, multiplying by 0.6 gives a $\\boxed{40\\%}$ discount.",
    "is_solved": false,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: The original price of the shirt is $\\$30$ and the first discount is $20\\%$. So the price after the first discount can be found by calculating $30(1-0.2)$.",
