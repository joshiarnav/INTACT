    "problem": "In a $100$ meter track event, Alice runs at a constant speed and crosses the finish line $5$ seconds before Beatrice does. If it took Beatrice $25$ seconds to complete the race, how many seconds would it take Alice to run $50$ meters?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Alice took $25 - 5 = 20$ seconds to complete the race. If she can run $100$ meters in $20$ seconds, by direct proportionality, she must be able to run $\\frac{100}{2} = 50$ meters in $\\frac{20}{2} = \\boxed{10}$ seconds.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1:  First, let's determine the speed of Alice and Beatrice. We know that Beatrice needs 25 seconds to complete the 100-meter race. Therefore, her speed can be calculated as 100 meters / 25 seconds = 4 meters/second.\nStep 2:  Since Alice crosses the finish line 5 seconds before Beatrice does, she completes the 100-meter race in 25 - 5 = 20 seconds. Now, we can calculate her speed as 100 meters / 20 seconds = 5 meters/second.\nStep 3:  To find out how many seconds it would take Alice to run 50 meters, we can use the speed we calculated earlier. We can find the time by dividing the distance by the speed, so time = distance / speed = 50 meters / 5 meters/second.\nStep 4: 50/5 = 10\nStep 5: \n10\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 10.",
