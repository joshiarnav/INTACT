    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common factor of 3 in the numerator and the common factor of 3 in the denominator will cancel: \\[\n\\frac{3^4+3^2}{3^3-3}=\\frac{3(3^3+3^1)}{3(3^2-1)}=\\frac{3^3+3^1}{3^2-1}\n\\] Now the numerator is $3^3+3=27+3=30$, and the denominator is $3^2-1=9-1=8$.  Therefore, the fraction simplifies to $\\dfrac{30}{8}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{4}}$.",
