    "problem": "A television's price was discounted $40\\%$ and then slashed another $40\\%$ during a liquidation sale. By what percent has the original price been reduced?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the original price of the television be $T$. Then the price is now $0.6(0.6T)=0.36T$. Thus overall the price has been reduced by $1-0.36=\\boxed{64\\%}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let x be the original price of the television.\nStep 2: After the first discount, the price of the television is 0.6x.\nStep 3: After the second discount, the price of the television is 0.6(0.6x) = 0.36x.\nStep 4: The price of the television has been reduced by $64\\%$ of the original price, which is $(0.64)x$.\nStep 5: The percent reduction is $\\frac{(0.64)x}{x} \\cdot 100\\% = 64\\%.$ Final Answer",
