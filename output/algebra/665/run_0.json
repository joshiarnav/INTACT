The second term is \\frac{1}{4} and the first term is 2, so the common ratio is \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}.\n\n\n## Step 3\nWe can then use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: X_n = X_1 * r^(n - 1), where X_n is the nth term, X_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.\n## Step 4\nTo find the fifth term, we substitute X_1 = 2, r = \\frac{1}{8}, and n = 5 into the formula X_n = X_1 * r^(n - 1).
