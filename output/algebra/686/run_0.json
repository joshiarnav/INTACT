    "problem": "Consider the geometric series $4+\\frac{12}{a}+\\frac{36}{a^2}+\\cdots$. If the sum is a perfect square, what is the smallest possible value of $a$ where $a$ is a positive integer?",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the formula $\\left(\\frac{\\text{first term}}{1-(\\text{common ratio})}\\right)$ for the sum of a geometric series to get the sum $\\left(\\frac{4}{1-\\frac{3}{a}}\\right)=\\frac{4}{\\frac{a-3}{a}}=\\frac{4a}{a-3}$. We want $\\frac{4a}{a-3}$ to be a perfect square $b^2$, where $b$ is a positive integer. So we have $4a=b^2(a-3)$ and start trying values for $b$ until we get a positive integer $a$.\nIf $b=1$, then $4a=a-3$, but that means $a=-1$.\nIf $b=2$, then $4a=4(a-3)\\qquad\\Rightarrow 0=-12$.\nIf $b=3$, then $4a=9(a-3)\\qquad\\Rightarrow -5a=-27$, which doesn't yield an integer value for $a$.\nIf $b=4$, then $4a=16(a-3)\\qquad\\Rightarrow -12a=-48$, so $a=\\boxed{4}$, which is a positive integer.\n\nOR\n\nFor an infinite geometric series to converge, the common ratio must be between $-1$ and $1$. Thus $\\frac{3}{a}$ must be less than 1, which means $a$ is greater than 3. We try $a=4$ and get that $\\left(\\frac{4}{1-\\frac{3}{4}}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{4}{\\frac{1}{4}}\\right)=4\\cdot4=16$, which is a perfect square.",
