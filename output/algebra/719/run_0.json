    "problem": "Laura is training for a triathlon, but she doesn't feel like swimming. She bikes $20$ miles at $2x+1$ miles per hour, spends five minutes parking her bike, changing to her running shoes, and catching a drink of water, and then runs $5$ miles at $x$ miles per hour. Her total workout lasts $110$ minutes. How fast did Laura run, to the nearest hundredth of a mile per hour?  (You may use a calculator on this problem.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since Laura spends $5$ minutes in transition, a total of $110-5=105$ minutes are spent in motion. This is equivalent to $\\frac{105}{60}=1.75$ hours. We know that $\\text{distance}=\\text{rate}\\cdot\\text{time}$, so $\\text{time}=\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}}$. Thus the time Laura spends biking is $\\frac{20\\text{ miles}}{2x+1\\text{ mph}}=\\frac{20}{2x+1}\\text{ hours}$, and the time she spends running is $\\frac{5\\text{ miles}}{x\\text{ mph}}=\\frac{5}{x}\\text{ hours}$. Thus the total time Laura is in motion is $$\\frac{20}{2x+1}\\text{ hours}+\\frac{5}{x}\\text{ hours}=1.75\\text{ hours}.$$We can solve this equation by multiplying through by a common denominator: \\begin{align*}\n(x)(2x+1)\\left(\\frac{20}{2x+1}+\\frac{5}{x}\\right)&=(1.75)(x)(2x+1)\\\\\n20(x)+5(2x+1)&=\\frac{7}{4}(2x^2+x)\\\\\n20x+10x+5&=\\frac{14x^2+7x}{4}\\\\\n4(30x+5)&=14x^2+7x\\\\\n120x+20&=14x^2+7x\\\\\n0&=14x^2-113x-20.\n\\end{align*}We can solve this using the quadratic formula, by writing  \\begin{align*}\nx&=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\\\\n&=\\frac{-(-113)\\pm\\sqrt{(-113)^2-4(14)(-20)}}{2(14)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{113\\pm\\sqrt{13889}}{28}.\n\\end{align*}The two solutions are approximately $-0.1733$ and $8.2447$. Since Laura isn't running at a negative speed, she runs $\\boxed{\\approx 8.24 \\text{ mph}}$.",
