    "problem": "A line parallel to $y = 4x + 6$ passes through $(5, 10)$. What is the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the $y$-axis?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the line is parallel to $y = 4x + 6$, we know that its slope is 4.  Thus the equation of the line is $y = 4x + b$ where $b$ is the $y$-intercept.  Plugging $(5, 10)$ into this gives $10 = 4\\cdot 5 + b \\Rightarrow b = \\boxed{-10}$ which is what we wanted.",
