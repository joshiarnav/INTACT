    "solution": "If the graph of $f$ can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper, then the graphs of the two cases must meet when $x=a$, which (loosely speaking) is the dividing point between the two cases.  Therefore, we must have  \\begin{align*}\n5a^2+2&=11a \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 5a^2-11a+2&=0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad (-5a+1)(-a+2)&=0.\n\\end{align*}Solving this equation gives $a=\\frac{1}{5}$ or $a=2$.
