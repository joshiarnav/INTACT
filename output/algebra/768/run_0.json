    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the number of pennies that Alex currently has, and let $b$ be the number of pennies that Bob currently has. If Alex gives Bob a penny, Alex will have $a - 1$ pennies and Bob will have $b + 1$ pennies. Also, Bob will have three times as many pennies as Alex has, so $b + 1 = 3(a - 1) = 3a - 3$. If Bob gives Alex a penny, Alex will have $a + 1$ pennies and Bob will have $b - 1$ pennies. Also, Bob will have twice as many pennies as Alex has, so $b - 1 = 2(a + 1) = 2a + 2$.\n\nIf we subtract the second equation from the first, we obtain $2 = a - 5$, so $a = 7$. Plugging this in, we can find that $b = 17$, so Bob has $\\boxed{17}$ pennies.",

    "model_solution": "Let A = the number of pennies Alex has, and B = the number of pennies Bob has.\n\n1. If Alex gives Bob a penny, Bob will have three times as many pennies as Alex has: B + 1 = 3(A - 1)\n2. If Bob gives Alex a penny, Bob will have twice as many pennies as Alex has: B - 1 = 2(A + 1)\n3. Multiply both sides of equation 1 by 2 and both sides of equation 2 by 3 to prepare for elimination: 2(B + 1) = 6(A - 1) and 3(B - 1) = 6(A + 1)\n4. Distribute and simplify the equations: 2B + 2 = 6A - 6 and 3B - 3 = 6A + 3\n5. Subtract 6A from both sides of the first simplified equation and 6A from both sides of the second simplified equation: 2B + 2 - 6A = -6 and 3B - 3 - 6A = 3\n6. Add the two resulting equations together to eliminate A: (2B + 2 - 6A) + (3B - 3 - 6A) = -6 + 3\n7. Combine like terms: 5B - 6A - 1 = -3\n8. Add 1 to both sides of the equation: 5B - 6A = -2\n9. Multiply both sides of the equation by -1 and then multiply both sides of the equation by 6 to make the coefficients of A in both equations equal: -5B + 6A = 2 and 5B - 6A = -2\n10. Add the two resulting equations together to eliminate A: (-5B + 6A) + (5B - 6A) = 2 + (-2)\n10. Simplify the equation: 0 = 0",
