    "problem": "If $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers for which $(x + y)^2 + (x - y)^2 = 10$ and $(x + y)^4 + (x - y)^4 = 98$, what is the value of $xy$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",

    "solution": "Expanding the first equation, it follows that $$10 = (x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 2x^2 + 2y^2,$$ so $x^2 + y^2 = 5\\ (*)$. Since \\begin{align*}(x+y)^4 &= x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4,\\\\ (x-y)^4 &= x^4 - 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 - 4xy^3 + y^4\\end{align*} by the Binomial Theorem, then $$(x+y)^4 + (x-y)^4 = 2x^4 + 12x^2y^2 + 2y^4 = 98.$$ Thus, $x^4 + 6x^2y^2 + y^4 = 49$.\n\nSquaring $(*)$ yields that $(x^2 + y^2)^2 = x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 = 25$. Subtracting this from the previous equation yields that $4x^2y^2 = 49-25 = 24$, so $x^2y^2 = 6$ and $xy = \\boxed{\\sqrt{6}}$.",
