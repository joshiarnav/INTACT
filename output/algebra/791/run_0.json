    "problem": "Positive integers $a$, $b$, and $2009$, with $a<b<2009$, form a geometric sequence with an integer ratio. What is $a$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $2009$ is $2009 = 7\\cdot 7\\cdot 41$. As $a<b<2009$, the ratio must be positive and larger than $1$. Hence, there is only one possibility: the ratio must be $7$, and thus $b=7\\cdot 41$ and $a=\\boxed{41}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let $r$ be the common ratio of the geometric sequence and write an equation for $b$ in terms of $a$ and $r$, then write an equation for $2009$ in terms of $a$ and $r$.\n$\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} b=ar \\\\ 2009=a\\left( ar \\right) \\end{array} \\right.$\nStep 2: Rewrite the second equation in the system from step 1 by distributing the $a$ to obtain $2009 = a^{2}r$.\n\nFinal Answer:",
