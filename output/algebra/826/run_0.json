    "problem": "On the Cartesian plane in which each unit is one foot, a dog is tied to a post on the point $(4,3)$ by a $10$ foot rope. What is the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The area the dog can go in is a circle of radius $10$ centered at the point $(4,3)$. The point farthest from $(0,0)$ in the circle would be the point on the circle's circumference which is on the same diameter as $(0,0)$ but on the other side of the center of the circle.\nThe distance from the origin to the center of the circle, by the distance formula, is $\\sqrt{(4-0)^2+(3-0)^2}=\\sqrt{16+9}=5$. As the radius of the circle is $10$, the distance from the origin to the point in the circle farthest from the origin is $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Draw a diagram of the situation, labeling the post at $(4,3)$ and the origin $O$ at $(0,0)$.\nStep 2: The greatest distance the dog can be from the origin is the sum of the distance from the origin to the post at $(4,3)$ and the length of the rope, which is $10$ feet.\nStep 3:  The distance from the origin to the post at $(4,3)$ is given by the distance formula, $\\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}$. Substituting the coordinates $(4,3)$ into the distance formula yields $\\sqrt{(4-0)^{2}+(3-0)^{2}}=\\sqrt{16+9}=\\sqrt{25}=5$ feet.\nStep 4: The total distance from the origin to the dog is the sum of the distance from the origin to the post and the length of the rope, which is $5 + 10 = 15$ feet.\nStep 5: The greatest distance the dog can be from the origin is therefore $15$ feet.
