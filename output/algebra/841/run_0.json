    "problem": "If the fourth term of an arithmetic sequence is $200$ and the eighth term is $500$, what is the sixth term?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sixth term is exactly halfway between the fourth and the eighth in the arithmetic sequence, so it is the average of the two terms. Therefore, the sixth term is $(200 + 500)/2 = \\boxed{350}$.  We also could have found the common difference by noting that there are four steps between the fourth term and the eighth term.  So, if $d$ is the common difference, we have $4d = 500-200 = 300$. Therefore, we find $d=75$.  The sixth term is two steps after the fourth, or $200 + 2d = \\boxed{350}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic sequence as \"a\" and the common difference as \"d\".\nSince the fourth term is $200$, we can write the equation $a + 3d = 200$. Similarly, for the eighth term being $500$, we have $a + 7d = 500$.\n## Step 2: Subtract the equation $a + 3d = 200$ from the equation $a + 7d = 500$ to eliminate \"a\" and find the value of \"d\".\n$(a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200$, which simplifies to $4d = 300$. Solving for \"d\" gives $d = 300/4 = 75$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{75}$",
