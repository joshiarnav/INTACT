    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "\\[0.72\\overline{6} = \\frac{7}{10} + \\frac{2}{10^2} + \\frac{6}{10^3} + \\frac{6}{10^4} + \\frac{6}{10^5} +\\cdots .\\]After the first two terms, the series on the right is an infinite geometric series with first term $6/10^3$ and common ratio $1/10$. So, we have \\[0.72\\overline{6} = \\frac{7}{10} + \\frac{2}{10^2} + \\frac{\\frac{6}{10^3}}{1-\\frac{1}{10}} = \\frac{72}{100} + \\frac{6}{900}= \\frac{654}{900} = \\boxed{\\frac{109}{150}}.\\]",
