    "problem": "A parabola with equation $y=x^2+bx+c$ passes through the points $(-1,-11)$ and $(3,17)$. What is $c$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We substitute these two points into the given equation to solve for $c$. Plugging in $(-1,-11)$, we get $-11=(-1)^2-1b+c\\Rightarrow -b+c=-12$. Plugging in $(3,17)$, we get $17=3^2+3b+c \\Rightarrow 3b+c=8$. In summary, we have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n-b+c&=-12\\\\\n3b+c&=8\n\\end{align*} Multiplying the first equation by 3, we have $-3b+3c=-36$. Adding the second equation to this last one, we have $(-3b+3c)+(3b+c)=-36+8 \\Rightarrow c=\\boxed{-7}$.\n\nThe parabola is graphed below: [asy]\n\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(-9,4,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nyaxis(-13,17,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn x^2+5x-7;\n\n}\n\ndraw(graph(f,-8,3), Arrows(4));\n\n[/asy]",
