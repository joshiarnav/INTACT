    "problem": "Suppose $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are polynomials in $z$, and the degree of $g(z)$ is less than the degree of $f(z)$.  If the degree of $f(z)$ is two, what is the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$?",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $f(z)=a_2 \\cdot z^2+a_1 \\cdot z+a_0$, and $g(z)=b_1 \\cdot z+b_0$, where $a_2$ is nonzero.  Then $f(z)+g(z)=a_2 \\cdot z^2+(a_1+b_1) \\cdot z+(a_0+b_0)$.  The degree of this polynomial is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Since the degree of $f(z)$ is two, $f(z)$ can be written as $az^2+bz+c$ for some constants $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $a$ is nonzero.\nStep 2:  Given that the degree of $g(z)$ is less than the degree of $f(z)$, we can express $g(z)$ as a polynomial of degree one or zero, i.e., $g(z) = dz + e$ or $g(z) = e$, where $d$ and $e$ are constants.\nStep 3:  To find the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$, we must consider the possible combinations of $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ and determine the degree of the resulting polynomial.\n\nHowever, the problem is not fully solved in this response.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to add $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ and determine the degree of the resulting polynomial.
