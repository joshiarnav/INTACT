    "problem": "Jo has given Aiden at least one toy car every birthday. The number of cars has corresponded to Aiden's age (one car for his first birthday, two cars for his second birthday, and so on). After receiving the cars for his 12th birthday, how many total toy cars will Aiden have received from Jo?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "After his 12th birthday, Aiden has received $1+2+\\cdots+12$ cars.  This sum is equal to $1 + 2 + \\dots + 12 = 12 \\cdot 13/2 = \\boxed{78}$.",
