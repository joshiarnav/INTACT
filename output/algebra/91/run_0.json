    "problem": "What is the value of $b$ if $-x^2+bx-5<0$ only when $x\\in (-\\infty, 1)\\cup(5,\\infty)$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "When $x<1$ or $x>5$, $-x^2+bx-5<0$. That means that $-x^2+bx-5=0$ at $x=1$ and $x=5$. So, the parabola has roots at 1 and 5, giving us $(x-1)(x-5)=0$. However, we also know the parabola opens downwards since the coefficient of $x^2$ is negative, so we have to negate one of the factors. We can now write $-x^2+bx-5=(1-x)(x-5)=-x^2+6x-5$. Thus, $b=\\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Since the parabola is negative only for $x\\in (-\\infty, 1)\\cup(5,\\infty)$, the roots of the equation $-x^2+bx-5=0$ must be $x=1$ and $x=5$.\nStep 2: Using the roots of the equation, $x=1$ and $x=5$, we can write the equation in factored form as $-(x-1)(x-5)=0$.\nStep 3: Multiply the factors $-(x-1)(x-5)=0$ to get $-x^2+6x-5=0$.\nStep 4: By equating the given equation $-x^2+bx-5=0$ with the equation $-x^2+6x-5=0$, we get b = 6.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$",
