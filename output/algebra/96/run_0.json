    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Notice that by the logarithmic identity $\\log(x) - \\log(y) = \\log\\frac{x}{y}$, the equations are equivalent to $\\log\\frac{x}{y}=a$, $\\log\\frac{y}{z}=15$, and $\\log\\frac{z}{x}=-7$ respectively. Adding all three equations together yields $\\log\\frac{x}{y} + \\log\\frac{y}{z} + \\log\\frac{z}{x} = a + 15 - 7$. From the identity $\\log (x) + \\log (y) = \\log (xy)$, we obtain $\\log\\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\cdot\\frac{y}{z}\\cdot\\frac{z}{x}\\right) = a + 8$. Cancelations result in $\\log(1) = a + 8$. Since $\\log(1) = 0$, we find $a = \\boxed{-8}$.",
