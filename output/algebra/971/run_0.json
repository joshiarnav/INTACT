    "problem": "What is the coefficient of $x^2$ when $-5x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 1$ is multiplied by $-x^2 - 6x + 1$ and the like terms are combined?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Instead of expanding the entire product, we can look only at terms that will multiply to give $x^2$.  We know that: $$x^2=x^2\\cdot 1=x\\cdot x=1\\cdot x^2$$Knowing this, the $x^2$ term in the expansion will be the sum of these three terms: $$(-5x^2)(1)+(-7x)(-6x)+(1)(-x^2)$$Simplifying gives: \\begin{align*}\n(-5x^2)(1)+(-7x)(-6x)+(1)(-x^2)&=-5x^2+42x^2-x^2\\\\\n&=\\boxed{36}x^2\n\\end{align*}Consequently, the desired coefficient is $\\boxed{36}$.",
