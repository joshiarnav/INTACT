    "problem": "What is the largest three-digit integer whose digits are distinct and form a geometric sequence?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we can find such a number whose hundreds digit is 9, then this number will be greater than any with a hundreds digit lower than 9. We want the common ratio to be as small as possible, so that the other digits are as large as possible. If $r$ is the common ratio, then the ones digit is $\\frac{9}{r^2}$. One might therefore expect that $r$ has a $3$ in its numerator. We could set $r=3$ for $931$. But $r=\\frac{3}{2}$ also works and is actually smaller, giving $\\boxed{964}$.\n\n(Note that $r=1$ would not give distinct digits, and $r<1$ would make the ones digit too large.)",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let the three-digit integer be $abc$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are distinct digits.\nStep 2: Since the digits form a geometric sequence, there exist distinct digits $a$, $r$, and $c$ such that $b = ar$ and $c = ar^2.$\nStep 3: Because $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits, we see that $1 \\le ar^2 \\le 9$, implying that $r^2 \\le 9/a$ and $r \\le 3/\\sqrt{a}$, and $a = 1$ or $2$ or $3$.\n\n Final Answer",
