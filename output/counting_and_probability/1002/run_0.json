    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We can find the probability that no women are selected and subtract it from 1 to find the probability that at least one woman is selected. To find the probability that only men are selected, we consider that the chance that the first person selected is male is $\\frac{7}{10}$. Then the probability that the second person selected is male is reduced to $\\frac{6}{9}=\\frac{2}{3}$. For the third person, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8}$. So the probability that only men are selected is $$\\frac{7}{10}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{5}{8}=\\frac{7}{24}.$$ Notice that the 2 and 5 in the numerator cancel with the 10 in the denominator to leave $\\frac{7}{24}$. Now we subtract from 1 to find the probability that at least one woman is selected. The probability is $1-\\frac{7}{24}=\\boxed{\\frac{17}{24}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Find the total number of ways to choose three people from the group of ten people. The total number of people is seven men and three women, so the total number of people is 10. We can choose three people from ten, so the total number of ways is $\\binom{10}{3}=\\frac{10!}{3!7!}=120$.\nStep 2:  Find the number of ways to choose three people from the group of seven men, which is $\\binom{7}{3}=\\frac{7!}{3!4!}=35$.\nStep 3:  Find the number of ways to choose at least one woman, which is the total number of ways to choose three people minus the number of ways to choose three men, so $120-35=85$. The probability is then $\\frac{85}{120}$, which can be simplified to $\\frac{17}{24}$.\nStep 4:  The final probability that at least one woman is selected is $\\frac{17}{24}$.\nStep 5:  The probability that at least one woman is selected is $\\frac{85}{120}$, which can be simplified to $\\frac{17}{24}$.\nStep 6:  Simplify $\\frac{85}{120}$ to $\\frac{17}{24}$.\nStep 7: Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{24}}$",
