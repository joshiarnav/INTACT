    "solution": "By the binomial theorem, $(m+n)^6$ expands as \\begin{align*}\n\\binom60m^6+\\binom61m^5n&+\\binom62m^4n^2+\\binom63m^3n^3\\\\\n&+\\binom64m^2n^4+\\binom65mn^5+\\binom66n^6.\n\\end{align*} Since $m$ and $n$ are odd, each of these terms is odd if and only if the binomial coefficient is odd. Since $\\binom60=\\binom66=1$, $\\binom61=\\binom65=6$, $\\binom62=\\binom64=15$, and $\\binom63=20$, exactly $\\boxed{4}$ of these terms are odd.",

We note that the binomial coefficient $\\binom{6}{i}$ is an integer, and since $m$ and $n$ are odd integers, $m^{6-i}$ and $n^{i}$ will be odd if and only if $i$ and $6-i$ are even, meaning $i$ is even.\nStep 3:  For $i = 0, 2, 4, 6$, we have even values, so the corresponding terms are odd.\nStep 3:  Therefore, there are $4$ terms that are odd.\nStep 3: Since $i$ ranges from $0$ to $6$, we are looking for even values of $i$ within this range, which are $0, 2, 4, 6$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, there are 4 terms that are odd.\nStep 5:  Since there are $4$ terms that are odd, there are $\\boxed{4}$ terms in the expansion of $(m+n)^6$ that are odd.\nStep 2:  Since $i$ ranges from $0$ to $6$, we are looking for even values of $i$ within this range, which are $0, 2, 4, 6$.\nStep 3: Since $i$ ranges from $0$ to $6$, we are looking for even values of $i$ within this range, which are $0, 2, 4, 6$.",
