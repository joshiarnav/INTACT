    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If the odds for pulling a prize out of the box are $3:4$, that means that 3 out of 7 times will result in a prize, while 4 out of 7 times will not. So the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{7}}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Since the odds for pulling a prize out of the box are 3:4, the total number of parts is 3 + 4 = 7.\nStep 2: The probability of not pulling a prize out of the box is the number of parts that do not have a prize divided by the total number of parts, which is $\\frac{4}{7}$.\nStep 3: Simplify the fraction $\\frac{4}{7}$ to its lowest terms.\nSince the fraction $\\frac{4}{7}$ is already in its lowest terms, the probability of not pulling a prize out of the box is $\\frac{4}{7}$.\nThere is no next step.\nStep 4: The fraction $\\frac{4}{7}$ is already in its lowest terms.\nStep 5: Since the fraction $\\frac{4}{7}$ is already in its lowest terms, this is the final answer.",
