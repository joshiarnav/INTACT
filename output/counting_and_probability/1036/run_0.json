    "solution": "Since we are told there are $20$ numbers in the first $4$ Rows, we want to find the $20^{\\mathrm{th}}$ number starting in Row 5. Since there are $10$ numbers in Row 5, and there are $12$ numbers in Row 6, the $20^{\\mathrm{th}}$ number if we start counting in Row 5 is located at the $10^{\\mathrm{th}}$ spot of Row 6, which is of course a $\\boxed{12}.$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Identify the pattern of the arrangement. Each row contains a repeated number that increases by $2$ with each subsequent row.\nStep 2: Determine how many numbers are in the first $4$ rows. We know that the first row contains $2$ numbers, the second row contains $4$ numbers, the third row contains $6$ numbers, and the fourth row contains $8$ numbers. So the total number of numbers in the first $4$ rows is $2+4+6+8=20$ numbers.\n\nNote that if you have already completed the final step, you must indicate that in your response.\nStep 3: Determine how many numbers are in the first $5$ rows. The first row has $2$ numbers, the second row has $4$ numbers, the third row has $6$ numbers, the fourth row has $8$ numbers, and the fifth row would have $10$ numbers. So the total number of numbers in the first $5$ rows is $2+4+6+8+10=30$ numbers.\nStep 4: Determine how many numbers are in the first $6$ rows. The first row has $2$ numbers, the second row has $4$ numbers, the third row has $6$ numbers, the fourth row has $8$ numbers, the fifth row has $10$ numbers, and the sixth row would have $12$ numbers. So the total number of numbers in the first $6$ rows is $2+4+6+8+10+12=42$ numbers.\nStep 5: Since the total number of numbers in the first 6 rows is 42, which is greater than 40, the 40th number must be located in the 6th row. The 6th row contains 12 numbers, and since the first 3 numbers in the 6th row are 12, 12, and 12, the 40th number is 12.\nStep 6: The 6th row contains 12 numbers, and since the first 3 numbers in the 6th row are 12, 12, and 12, the 40th number is 12.\nStep 7:\nThe 6th row contains 12 numbers, and since the first 3 numbers in the 6th row are 12, 12, and 12, the 40th number is 12.\nStep 8:\nThe $40^{\\text {th }}$ number will be in the sixth row, and the sixth row contains the number $12 .$\nStep 5: Since the total number of numbers in the first 6 rows is 42, which is greater than 40, the 40th number must be located in the 6th row. The 6th row contains 12 numbers, and since the first 3 numbers in the 6th row are 12, 12, and 12, the 40th number is 12.",
