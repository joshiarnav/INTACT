    "solution": "Since for all $n \\ge 10$, $n!$ has (at least) two factors of 5, we know that $n!$ will end in two zeros.  Therefore, if $n\\ge 10$, then $n!$ contributes nothing to the last two digits of the sum. So we need only compute $5! = 120$, and hence our answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",

This means we need to find the value of the given sum modulo 100.\nStep 3:  Since $10! = 3628800$, we can see that for any $n \\geq 10$, the factorial $n!$ will be divisible by 100.
