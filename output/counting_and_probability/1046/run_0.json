    "problem": "How many ways are there for 8 people to sit around a circular table if none of Alice, Bob, and Eve (three of the 8 people) want to sit next to each other? Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First choose a seat for Alice. It doesn't matter what seat we choose because we can rotate the table to move Alice's seat to wherever we want. After Alice's seat has been chosen, there are five seats Bob is willing to sit in. Of these seats, 2 are two seats away from Alice, and 3 are not. If Bob sits in either of the locations two seats away from Alice, there will be 3 places left Eve is willing to sit. If he sits in one of the other seats, there will be 2 places left Eve is willing to sit. Once Alice, Bob, and Eve's seats have been chosen, the remaining people can be placed in $5!$ ways. Therefore, the total number of ways for the 8 people to sit around the table is $2\\cdot3\\cdot5!+3\\cdot2\\cdot5!=\\boxed{1440}$.",
