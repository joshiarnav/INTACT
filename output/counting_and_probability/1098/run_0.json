    "solution": "If the lower cells contain $A$, $B$ and $C$, then the second row will contain $A + B$ and $B + C$, and the top cell will contain $A + 2B+C$. To obtain the smallest sum, place 1  in the center cell and 2 and 3 in the outer ones. The top number will be 7. For the largest sum, place 9 in the center cell and 7 and 8 in the outer ones. This top number will be 33. The difference is $33-7=\\boxed{26}$.",

Then the top integer is $a+b+c, b+c, c$, or $c$.\nTo maximize the value of the top cell, we should make $a+b$ as large as possible. The largest possible value of $a+b$ is $9+8=17$. In this case, the largest possible value for $c$ is $7$, so the largest possible value for the top cell is $17+7=24$.\n\nTo minimize the value of the top cell, we should make $a+b$ as small as possible. The smallest possible value of $a+b$ is $1+2=3$, so the smallest possible value for $c$ is $1$ and the smallest possible value for the top cell is $3+1=\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20.
