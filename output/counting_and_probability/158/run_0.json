    "solution": "We start off with $\\emph{1}$ large rectangle. Then the horizontal and vertical lines together split the large rectangle into $\\emph{4}$ smaller rectangles. In addition, the vertical line by itself splits the large rectangle into $\\emph{2}$ rectangles and the horizontal line by itself splits the large rectangle into $\\emph{2}$ other rectangles. There are $1+4+2+2=\\boxed{9}$ different rectangles in the figure.",

The horizontal lines are the top and bottom edges of the large rectangle, while the vertical lines are the left and right edges.\nStep 3:  The vertical line in the figure can be paired with any of the horizontal lines to form a rectangle. There are 3 horizontal lines that can be paired with the vertical line, so there are 3 rectangles formed this way.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
