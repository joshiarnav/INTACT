    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let the polygon have $n$ sides. The number of diagonals then is $n(n-3)/2$, because each vertex is connected to $n-3$ other vertices by diagonals, but $n(n-3)$ counts each diagonal twice.  We then have $$n=\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\\implies 1=\\frac{n-3}{2}\\implies n=\\boxed{5}$$",
