    "solution": "If a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists, the triangle inequality must be satisfied, which states that $x+y>1$, $1+x>y$, and $1+y>x$.  We can draw a plane with $x$ and $y$ axes and shade in the area where all of these inequalities are satisfied.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,3));\nlabel(\"$x$\",(3,0),S);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,3),W);\nfill((1,0)--(3,2)--(3,3)--(2,3)--(0,1)--cycle,gray(.7));\ndraw((1,-.1)--(1,.1));\ndraw((2,-.1)--(2,.1));\ndraw((.1,1)--(-.1,1));\ndraw((.1,2)--(-.1,2));\n\ndraw((1,0)--(0,1));\ndraw((1,0)--(3,2));\ndraw((0,1)--(2,3));\n\n[/asy]\n\nThe total area of the square is $3^2=9$.  The area of the unshaded region is $2^2+1/2=9/2$.  Thus, the shaded area is $9/2$ and the probability that such a triangle exists is $(9/2)/9=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
