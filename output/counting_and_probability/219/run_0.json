    "solution": "Instead of directly finding the probability that at least two faces match, we can find the probability that no faces match and then subtract the result from 1. The results on the three dice are independent of each other, so we compute the probability for each die and then multiply the probabilities. The first die does not have to be a particular number. There are 6 possible numbers, but any number will work, so the probability is $\\frac{6}{6}=1$. In order for the second die to have a different number from the first, there are 5 other numbers out of the 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\\frac{5}{6}$. For the third die to have a different number from the first and second, there are 4 other numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\\frac{4}{6}=\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability that no faces match is $1\\times\\frac{5}{6}\\times\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{5}{9}$. That means the probability that at least two faces match is $1-\\frac{5}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  To find the probability that at least two faces match when rolling three fair six-sided dice, we will use the complement rule and calculate the probability that no two dice show the same face, then subtract that probability from 1.\nTherefore, we need to find the probability that all three dice show different faces.\nStep 2:  The total number of outcomes when rolling three six-sided dice is $6^3 = 216$, since each die has 6 possible outcomes.\n\nNote: Since this is not the final step, there are more steps to solve the problem.\nStep 2:  Now, we need to find the number of ways in which the three dice can show different faces. For the first die, there are $6$ possible outcomes. The second die has $5$ possible outcomes because it cannot match the first die. The third die has $4$ possible outcomes because it cannot match the first two dice. Thus, the total number of ways in which the three dice can show different faces is $6 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 120$.\nStep 3:  The probability that no two dice show the same face is the number of ways in which the three dice can show different faces divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{120}{216}$\nStep 4:  Using the complement rule, we subtract the probability that no two dice show the same face from 1 to obtain the probability that at least two faces match. Thus, the probability is $1 - \\frac{120}{216} = \\frac{96}{216}$. Simplifying, we get $\\frac{4}{9}$.\nStep 5: Simplify the fraction $\\frac{96}{216}$ to obtain the probability that at least two faces match.\nStep 6: \n$\\frac{96}{216}$\n$\\frac{96}{216}$\nSimplify the fraction $\\frac{96}{216}$\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by their greatest common divisor, which is 24, to simplify the fraction.",
