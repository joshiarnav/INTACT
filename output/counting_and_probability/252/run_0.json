    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Since each ball can go into one of two boxes, we need to determine the number of choices for each ball.\nStep 2: Each of the 4 distinguishable balls has 2 choices of boxes to go into.\nStep 3: Multiply the number of choices for each ball (2) by itself 4 times (for the 4 balls) to find the total number of ways to put the balls into the boxes.\nStep 4: The total number of ways is 2^4 = 16.\nThe final answer is: 16",
