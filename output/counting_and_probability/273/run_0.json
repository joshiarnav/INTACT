    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we only need to consider the number of the balls in boxes without considering order.  The arrangements are (4,0,0),(3,1,0),(2,2,0),(2,1,1), for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ ways.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we can represent the number of balls in each box as a partition of 4, which is the total number of balls. \n\nThe possible partitions of 4 are: \n- 4 (all balls in one box)\n- 3+1 (3 balls in one box and 1 in another)\n- 2+2 (2 balls in each of two boxes)\n- 2+1+1 (2 balls in one box, and 1 in each of the other two)\n- 1+1+1+1 (all balls are in separate boxes)\nStep 2: Since the boxes are indistinguishable, partitions with the same number of \"blocks\" (e.g. 4, 2+1+1, 1+1+1+1) are the same, so we need to find the distinct partitions.\nStep 3: \n- 4 (all balls in one box)\n- 3+1\n- 2+2\n- 2+1+1\n- 1+1+1+1\nStep 4: \n- 4 (all in 1 box) = 1 way\n- 3+1 = 1 way\n- 2+2 = 1 way\n- 2+1+1 = 1 way\n- 1+1+1+1 = 1 way\n\nThere are 5 ways to put 4 indistinguishable balls in 3 indistinguishable boxes.\nFinal Answer",
