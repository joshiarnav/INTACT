    "problem": "A team averages 7 losses for every 13 games it wins. If ties are not permitted, what is the probability that the team will win its next game? Express your answer as a percent.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If a team averages 7 losses for 13 wins, that means the team wins 13 out of 20 games, and $\\frac{13}{20} = .65$, or $\\boxed{65\\%}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of games played\nLet x be the number of games the team wins, and 7x be the number of games it loses. The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, which is 13x + 7x = 20x.\n## Step 2: Determine the probability of winning the next game\nThe team wins 13 games for every 20 total games. Since the next game is independent of the previous games, the probability of winning the next game is 13/20. To express the answer as a percent, multiply by 100.\n## Step 3: Convert the probability to a percent\n13/20 * 100 = 65%\n\nFinal Answer",
