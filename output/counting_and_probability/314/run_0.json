    "solution": "We let the $x$ axis represent the time Allen arrives, and the $y$ axis represent the time Bethany arrives.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(60,0), Arrow);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,60), Arrow);\nlabel(\"1:00\", (0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"1:15\", (0,15), W);\nlabel(\"1:45\", (60,45), E);\nlabel(\"1:15\", (15,0), S);\nlabel(\"2:00\", (60,0), S);\nlabel(\"2:00\", (0,60), W);\nfill((0,0)--(60,60)--(60,45)--(15,0)--cycle, gray(.7));\nfill((0,0)--(60,60)--(45,60)--(0,15)--cycle, gray(.7));\n[/asy]\n\nThe shaded region represents the times that Allen and Bethany would see each other at the party.  For example, if Allen arrived at 1:30, Bethany could arrive at any time between 1:15 and 1:45 and see Allen at the party.  Let one hour equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This will be equal to $2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{9}{16}$.  So, the area of the shaded region is $1-\\frac{9}{16}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{16}}$.  Since the area of the square is 1, this is the probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party.",
