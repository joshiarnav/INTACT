    "problem": "How many ways are there to assign each of 6 friends to either the chemistry class or the biology class if one of these six, Manoj, refuses to be in a class without any of his friends?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "For each friend, there are 2 choices for which class to place them in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 6 friends, we multiply the number of choices together. Hence there are $2^6 = 64$ ways to split the friends into two classes. However, 2 of those 64 arrangements are invalid: we can't put Manoj in chemistry and everyone else in biology, and we can't put Manoj in biology and everyone else in chemistry. So our final answer is $64-2=\\boxed{62}$.",
