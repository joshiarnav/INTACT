    "solution": "The largest number of pencils that any friend can have is four. There are 3 ways that this can happen: $(4,1,1)$, $(1,4,1)$ and $(1,1,4)$. There are 6 ways one person can have 3 pencils: $(3,2,1)$, $(3,1,2)$, $(2,3,1)$, $(2,1,3)$, $(1,2,3)$ and $(1,3,2)$. There is only one way all three can have two pencils each: $(2,2,2)$. The total number of possibilities is $3+6+1=\\boxed{10}$.",
