    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 20-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^4=\\frac{1}{16}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $6\\cdot \\frac{1}{16}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$.",
