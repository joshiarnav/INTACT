    "problem": "How many three-digit whole numbers have no 7's and no 9's as digits?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit. But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits. So, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{448}$ such numbers.",

For the tens place and the ones place, since we cannot use 7 or 9, we have 8 options each (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8).\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of three-digit numbers with no 7's and no 9's as digits.\nTotal = 7 * 8 * 8 = 448\n## Step 4: No additional steps are needed, the solution is complete.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{448}$",
