We have several options:\n\nIf $a+b=1$, it must be $(1,0)$, one possibility.\n\nFor $a+b=4$, $a$ can be $1$ to $4$, for four possibilities.\n\nFor $a+b=7$, $a$ can be $1$ to $7$, so seven possibilities.\n\nFor $a+b=10$, anything from $(1,9)$ to $(9,1)$ works, so nine possibilities.\n\nFor $a+b=13$, the pairs range from $(4,9)$ to $(9,4)$, for six possibilities.\n\nIf $a+b=16$, we can have $(7,9)$, $(8,8)$, or $(9,7)$, so three possibilities.\n\n$a+b=19$ and up is not possible.\n\nSo the total number is\n\n$$1+4+7+9+6+3=\\boxed{30}$$",
