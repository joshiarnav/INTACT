    "solution": "There are 8 Republicans and 3 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways to choose the Republicans.  There are 6 Democrats and 2 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the Democrats.  So there are $56 \\times 15 = \\boxed{840}$ ways to choose the subcommittee.",
