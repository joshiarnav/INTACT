    "solution": "The number of possible rolls of 5 dice is $6^5$, since there are 6 possibilities for each of the 5 dice.  Now we count the number of ways to get a 1 or a 2 in exactly 3 of the 5 rolls. First, we pick which 3 of the 5 rolls are 1 or 2: we can do that in $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways.  Now for each of these 3 rolls, there are 2 choices, and for each of the other 2 rolls, there are 4 choices.  Thus the probability is \\[\\frac{\\binom{5}{3}2^34^2}{6^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{40}{243}}.\\]",
