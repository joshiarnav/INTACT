    "problem": "Mary has $6$ identical basil plants, and three different window sills she can put them on. How many ways are there for Mary to put the plants on the window sills?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since the plants are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of plants on each window sill.\n\nIf all the plants are on one window  sill, there are $3$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $5$ plants are on one window sill and the last is on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants go on which window sill.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are each on one of the other windows, there are $3$ ways to choose which window the $4$ plants are on.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window and the other $3$ plants are all on another window, there are $3$ ways to choose which window has no plants.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window, $2$ plants on another window, and $1$ plant on the last window, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants are on which windows.\n\nIf $2$ plants are on each window, there is only one way to arrange them.\n\nIn total, there are $3+6+6+3+3+6+1=\\boxed{28}$ ways to arrange the plants on the window sills.\n\nSee if you can find a faster way to do this problem by considering lining up the plants, and placing two dividers among the plants to separate them into three groups corresponding to the sills.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the type of problem: This is a combinatorics problem involving identical objects being placed into distinct groups, also known as a \"stars and bars\" problem.\nStep 2: Since the objects are identical, we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 identical objects into 3 distinct groups. This can be represented as a stars and bars problem, where the objects are represented by stars and the dividers between the groups are represented by bars.\nStep 3: We will use the formula for distributing n identical objects into k distinct groups, which is (n+k-1) choose (k-1). In this case, n = 6 and k = 3.\nStep 4: Calculate the combination using the formula: (6+3-1) choose (3-1) = 8 choose 2.\nStep 5: Evaluate the combination 8 choose 2: $\\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!}=\\frac{8\\cdot 7}{2}=28$\nStep 6: \n$28$\nStep 7: Since the plants are identical, the order within each group does not matter, so we do not need to consider the arrangements of the plants within each group.
