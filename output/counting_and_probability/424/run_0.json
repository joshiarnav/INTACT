    "problem": "How many three digit numbers are left if we exclude all three digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits. There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B. Since there are $9\\cdot10\\cdot10=900$ total three digit numbers, and $9\\cdot9=81$ numbers which aren't valid, there are $900-81=\\boxed{819}$ valid numbers.",

There are 9 choices for the hundreds digit (1-9), 9 choices for the tens digit (0 and the 8 other digits that are not the same as the hundreds digit), and 1 choice for the ones digit (it must be the same as the hundreds digit). Multiply 9 * 9 * 1 = 81.\nStep 3: \nSubtract the count of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same but not adjacent from the total number of three-digit numbers.\n900 - 81 = 819.\nStep 4: \nThe result from Step 3 is the answer to the problem.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 819.",
