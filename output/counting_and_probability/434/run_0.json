    "solution": "We consider the subset $\\{ 1, 3, 5, 7 \\}$ which consists only of the odd integers in the original set. Any subset consisting entirely of odd numbers must be a subset of this particular subset. And, there are $2^4 - 1 = \\boxed{15}$ non-empty subsets of this 4-element set, which we can easily see by making the choice of including or not including each element.",

Therefore, there are $2^4=16$ possible subsets that can be formed from these elements. However, we need to exclude the empty set from the count of subsets, so the total number of non-empty subsets consisting entirely of odd numbers is $16 - 1 = 15$.\nStep 3:  The total number of non-empty subsets consisting entirely of odd numbers is $\\boxed{15}$.\nStep 4:  The total number of non-empty subsets consisting entirely of odd numbers is $\\boxed{15}$.\nStep 5:  The total number of non-empty subsets consisting entirely of odd numbers is $\\boxed{15}$.\nStep 6:  Since there are 4 odd numbers in the set $\\{ 1, 3, 5, 7 \\}$, the total number of non-empty subsets consisting entirely of odd numbers is $\\boxed{15}$.\nStep 7:  The total number of non-empty subsets consisting entirely of odd numbers is $\\boxed{15}.$\nStep 8:  For each of the 4 elements in the set {1, 3, 5, 7}, there are 2 possibilities: either the element is included in the subset or it is not.
