    "problem": "Our school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if exactly two of the triplets are in the starting lineup?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If exactly two of the triplets are in the lineup, we have 3 choices for which triplets to put in the starting lineup (we can see this by noting that we have 3 choices for which triplet to leave out), and then 11 people to choose from for the remaining 4 spots.  So the answer is $3 \\times \\binom{11}{4} = 3 \\times 330= \\boxed{990}$.",
