    "problem": "In how many ways can I place 5 different beads on a bracelet if rotations and flips of the bracelet are not treated as different arrangements?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $5!$ ways to arrange 5 beads in a line.  Since there are 5 rotations in a circle for each of these arrangements, we must divide by 5, and since there are two matching reflections for each arrangement, we must divide by 2.  So there are $\\dfrac{5!}{5 \\times 2} = \\boxed{12}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of arrangements without considering rotations and flips\nThere are 5! = 120 ways to arrange the 5 beads in a line.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of equivalent rotations\nSince the bracelet can be rotated 5 ways, each unique arrangement has 5 equivalent rotations.\n\n## Step 3: Account for the equivalent rotations by dividing the total number of arrangements by the number of rotations\nDivide 120 by 5 to account for the equivalent rotations, resulting in 24 unique arrangements.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of equivalent flips\nSince the bracelet can be flipped over, each unique arrangement has 2 equivalent flips.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the equivalent flips by dividing the number of unique arrangements by the number of flips\nDivide 24 by 2 to account for the equivalent flips, but since we are determining how the beads can be arranged without considering the flips as different arrangements, we do not divide.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$",
