    "problem": "An airline serves a dinner to all the passengers on an airplane. They get their choice of steak or fish. Three steak meals and three fish meals are set aside for the six-member crew. If the meals are distributed to the crew members randomly, what is the probability that both pilots get the fish?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 of the 6 meals for the pilots. There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to choose 2 of the 3 fish meals. So the probability is $3/15 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to distribute the meals to the crew members. There are 6 crew members with a choice of 6 meals, so the total number of ways to distribute the meals is 6! = 720, but 3 meals are set aside which leaves only 3 meals for the pilots and 3 for the rest of the crew, so the total number of ways is 3! * 3! = 36.\nStep 2: Determine the number of ways the two pilots can get the fish. There are 3 fish meals available for the 2 pilots, so they can get the fish in 3 * 2 = 6 ways. The remaining crew members can get the steak meals in 3! = 6 ways. The number of ways the pilots can get the fish is 6 * 6 = 36.\nStep 3: Calculate the probability that both pilots get the fish by dividing the number of ways the pilots can get the fish by the total number of ways to distribute the meals.\nStep 4: Calculate the probability that both pilots get the fish by dividing the number of ways the pilots can get the fish by the total number of ways to distribute the meals: 36 / 36 = 1\nStep 4: The probability that both pilots get the fish is 36 / 36 = 1\nStep 5: The probability that both pilots get the fish is 36/36 = 1\nStep 6: The probability that both pilots get the fish is 1, which is a certainty.\nStep 4: The probability that both pilots get the fish is 1.\nNone of the steps provided lead to the correct answer.
