    "problem": "Three numbers, $a_1\\,$, $a_2\\,$, $a_3\\,$, are drawn randomly and without replacement from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 1000\\}\\,$. Three other numbers, $b_1\\,$, $b_2\\,$, $b_3\\,$, are then drawn randomly and without replacement from the remaining set of 997 numbers. Let $p\\,$ be the probability that, after a suitable rotation, a brick of dimensions $a_1 \\times a_2 \\times a_3\\,$ can be enclosed in a box of dimensions $b_1 \\times b_2 \\times b_3\\,$, with the sides of the brick parallel to the sides of the box. If $p\\,$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?\n",

    "solution": "Call the six numbers selected $x_1 > x_2 > x_3 > x_4 > x_5 > x_6$. Clearly, $x_1$ must be a dimension of the box, and $x_6$ must be a dimension of the brick.\nIf $x_2$ is a dimension of the box, then any of the other three remaining dimensions will work as a dimension of the box. That gives us $3$ possibilities.\nIf $x_2$ is not a dimension of the box but $x_3$ is, then both remaining dimensions will work as a dimension of the box. That gives us $2$ possibilities.\nIf $x_4$ is a dimension of the box but $x_2,\\ x_3$ aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, there are no possibilities (same for $x_5$).\nThe total number of arrangements is ${6\\choose3} = 20$; therefore, $p = \\frac{3 + 2}{20} = \\frac{1}{4}$, and the answer is $1 + 4 = \\boxed{5}$.",
