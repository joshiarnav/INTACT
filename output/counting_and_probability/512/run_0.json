    "solution": "Steve can use no quarters or one quarter, for two possibilities.\n\nSteve can use 0, 1, or 2 nickels, for three possibilities.\n\nAnd Steve can use 0, 1, 2, or 3 pennies, for four possibilities.  That gives $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 24$ possible combinations.  But we must remove the combination where Steve does not use any coins, leaving us with $24 - 1 = \\boxed{23}.$",
