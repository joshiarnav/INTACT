    "problem": "In how many ways can we form an international commission if we must choose one European country from among 6 European countries, one Asian country from among 4, one North American country from among 3, and one African country from among 7?",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are six ways in which one European country can be chosen, four in which one Asian country can be chosen, three in which one North American country can be chosen, and seven in which one African country can be chosen. Thus, there are $6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{504}$ ways to form the international commission.",
