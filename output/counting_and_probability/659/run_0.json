    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the relevant formula for the expansion\nThe expansion of the given expression can be found using the Binomial Theorem, which states that for any non-negative integer n, \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\\). In this case, we have \\(n = 6\\), \\(a = x\\), and \\(b = \\frac{1}{x}\\).\n## Step 2: Apply the Binomial Theorem to identify the term containing $x^2$\nThe term containing $x^2$ will have $x^2$ in the form of $x^{6-k}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^k$. We need to find the value of k that satisfies this condition.\n## Step 3: Determine the value of k for the term containing $x^2$\nTo find the term containing $x^2$, we need to solve for k in the equation $x^{6-k}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^k = x^2$. Since $x^{6-k}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^k = x^{6-2k}$, we can equate the exponents to find that $6-2k = 2$, which gives us $k = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\binom{6}{2}}$",
