    "problem": "The planning committee at school has 11 members. Exactly five of these members are teachers. A four-person subcommittee with at least one member who is not a teacher must be formed from the members of the planning committee. How many distinct subcommittees are possible?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Because there are 5 teachers on the committee, there are 6 non-teachers. Now, in total, we can form ${11 \\choose 4} = 330$ subcomittees. The number of subcommittees with zero non-teachers is the number of subcommittees formed by the 5 teachers, totaling ${5 \\choose 4} = 5$. So, the number of subcomittees with at least one non-teacher is $330 - 5 = \\boxed{325}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Find the number of distinct subcommittees that are possible from the total of 11 members, which is $\\binom{11}{4}$.\nStep 2: Determine the number of subcommittees that consist entirely of teachers. This can be calculated by finding the number of distinct subcommittees possible from the 5 teachers, which is $\\binom{5}{4}$.\nStep 3: Subtract the number of subcommittees that consist entirely of teachers from the total number of subcommittees to find the number of subcommittees that have at least one member who is not a teacher.\nStep 4: Find the number of subcommittees with at least 1 non-teacher member by subtracting the number of subcommittees made up entirely of teachers from the total number of subcommittees: $\\binom{11}{4} - \\binom{5}{4}$.
