    "problem": "Gerry goes to sleep at 11 pm each night. But he doesn't sleep very well, so he awakens at a random time between 1:00 am and 3:59 am, with each minute equally likely (including 1:00 and 3:59). He then reads the hour and minute shown on his clock as a three digit number, so 2:56 am would be 256. What is the probability that that number will be divisible by 7?",
