    "problem": "Seven cards each containing one of the following letters C, B, T, A, E, M and H are placed in a hat. Each letter is used only once. Stu will pull four cards out at random and without replacement. What is the probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The probability that Stu pulls the M out first is 1/7. The probability that he then pulls the A out next is 1/6, since there are now 6 letter remaining.  Continuing in this way, the probability that he pulls out T next is 1/5 and the probability that H then follows is 1/4.  Therefore, the probability that he pulls out M, A, T, H in this order is $1/7 \\times 1/6 \\times 1/5 \\times 1/4 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{840}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  There are 7 cards in the hat with letters C, B, T, A, E, M, and H. Stu will pull 4 cards out at random and without replacement. The first card he pulls can be any one of the 7 letters. Therefore, the probability of Stu pulling the letter M first is 1/7.\nStep 2:  Given that M has been pulled, there are 6 cards remaining in the hat, with 5 of them being the letters C, B, T, A, E, and H. The probability that Stu pulls the letter A second is 1/6.\nStep 3:  Given that M and A have been pulled, there are 5 cards remaining in the hat, with 4 of them being the letters C, B, T, and E, H. The probability that Stu pulls the letter T third is 1/5.\nStep 4:  Given that M, A, and T have been pulled, there are 4 cards remaining in the hat, with 3 of them being the letters C, B, E, and H. The probability that Stu pulls the letter H fourth is 1/4.\nStep 5:  The probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual event: (1/7) * (1/6) * (1/5) * (1/4) = 1/840.\nStep 6: The total number of possible outcomes when Stu pulls four cards out of seven is 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 = 840.\n \nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{840}}$.",
