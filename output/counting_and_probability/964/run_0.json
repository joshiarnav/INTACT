    "problem": "I have two cubes such that, on each cube, three faces are painted red and three faces are painted white. If I roll each of the cubes once, what is the probability that they will land such that there is one red face and one white face up?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are four possible ways for the cubes to land: two red faces up, the first with a red face and the second with a white face up, the first with a white face and the second with a red face up, and two white faces up. So, there are two ways that the cubes can land such that there is a red face up and a white face up. The probability that we get a red face up is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, the probability that we get a white face up is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that the cubes land such that there is one red face and one white face up is $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nAlternate solution: After you roll the first cube, the second one must be the other color, which occurs with probability $\\frac{3}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes for each cube when rolled.\nEach cube has 6 faces, so it can land in 6 different ways. Since we are rolling two cubes, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36.\nStep 2: Determine the number of successful outcomes for the given scenario.\nThere are two ways for one red face and one white face to appear on each cube: (red on the first cube and white on the second) or (white on the first cube and red on the second). The first scenario can occur in 3 ways on the first cube and 3 ways on the second, making 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 ways. The second scenario can also occur in 3 ways on the first cube and 3 ways on the second, making 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 ways. Therefore, the total number of successful outcomes is 9 + 9 = 18.\nStep 3: Calculate the probability by dividing the number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n36 / 18 = 2\nStep 4: Simplify the fraction 2.\nStep 4: Since the simplified fraction 2 is a whole number, the probability is 2/3.\nStep 4: Simplify the fraction 2 (however, the simplification is incorrect, the correct simplification would be 2 = 2/1).\nStep 4: 2/1 = 2/1\nStep 4: 2/1 = 2/1",
