    "problem": "Ryan has 3 red lava lamps and 3 blue lava lamps. He arranges them in a row on a shelf randomly, then turns 3 random lamps on. What is the probability that the leftmost lamp on the shelf is red, and the leftmost lamp which is turned on is also red?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways for Ryan to arrange the lamps, and $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways for him to choose which lamps are on, giving $20\\cdot20=400$ total possible outcomes. There are two cases for the desired outcomes: either the left lamp is on, or it isn't. If the left lamp is on, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which other lamps are on, and $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which other lamps are red. This gives $10\\cdot10=100$ possibilities. If the first lamp isn't on, there are $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways to choose which lamps are on, and since both the leftmost lamp and the leftmost lit lamp must be red, there are $\\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways to choose which other lamp is red. This case gives 40 valid possibilities, for a total of 140 valid arrangements out of 400. Therefore, the probability is $\\dfrac{140}{400}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{20}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the total number of ways Ryan can arrange the 6 lamps in a row on the shelf.\nThe total number of ways is 6!/(3!*3!) = 20.\nStep 2: Determine the number of ways the leftmost lamp can be red and the leftmost lamp turned on can also be red.\nThe number of ways is 3!/2!*1!*3!/2! = 3.\nStep 3: The probability that the leftmost lamp is red is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability that the leftmost lamp turned on is also red, given that the leftmost lamp is red, is 3/5, so the desired probability is (1/2) * (3/5) = 3/10.\nStep 4: The probability that the leftmost lamp is red is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability that the leftmost lamp turned on is also red, given that the leftmost lamp is red, is 3/5, so the desired probability is (1/2) * (3/5) = 3/10.\nStep 5: The probability that the leftmost lamp is red and the leftmost lamp turned on is also red is the same regardless of the color of the lamp on the left, so we can multiply the probability found in Step 4 by the probability that the lamp on the left is red, which is 1/2. Therefore, the desired probability is (1/2) * (3/10) = 3/20.\nStep 6: The probability that the leftmost lamp is red and the leftmost lamp turned on is also red is the same regardless of the color of the lamp on the left, so we can multiply the probability found in Step 4 by the probability that the lamp on the left is red, which is 1/2 for red lamp and 1/2 for blue lamp. Therefore, the desired probability is (1/2) * (3/10) * (1/2) + (1/2) * (3/10) * (1/2) = (3/20) + (3/20) = 3/10.\nStep 7: We can also determine the probability by finding the probability that neither the leftmost lamp nor the first lamp turned on is red, then subtracting this probability from 1.\nStep 8: The probability that the leftmost lamp is not red is 3/6 = 1/2 and the probability that the first lamp turned on is not red, given that the leftmost lamp is not red, is 5/5 = 1. The probability that neither is red is (1/2) * 1 = 1/2. The probability that at least one of them is red is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The probability that the leftmost lamp and the first lamp turned on are both red is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\nStep 9: The probability that the leftmost lamp and the first lamp turned on are both red is the same as the probability that the leftmost lamp in the row is red and the leftmost lamp turned on is also red, which is 1/2.\nStep 10: The probability that the leftmost lamp in the row is red and the leftmost lamp turned on is red is (3/6) * (3/(6-1)) / (6! / (3! * 3!)) = (1/2) * (3/5) / (20) = 3/40.",
