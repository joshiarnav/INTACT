    "problem": "23 people attend a party. Each person shakes hands with at least one other person. What is the minimum possible number of handshakes?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If each person shakes hands with exactly one other person, then there will be $\\frac{23 \\cdot 1}{2}$ handshakes, since two people are required to complete a handshake. This is equal to 11.5 handshakes, which is clearly impossible. We can achieve 12 handshakes by forming two rows of 11 and 12 people. Each person in the first row shakes hands a different person in the second row. This will give eleven handshakes. The leftover person must shake hands with someone, giving $\\boxed{12}$ handshakes total.",

    "model_solution": "Let's assume that each person shakes hands with exactly one other person.\nIf each person shakes hands with exactly one other person, then the number of handshakes is 23/2, since each handshake involves two people.\nSince 23 is an odd number, it is not possible for each person to shake hands with exactly one other person. We need at least one person to shake hands with two other people.\nLet's arrange the people in a circle and have each person shake hands with the two people next to them.\nEach person shakes hands with two other people, so the total number of handshakes is 23.\nThis arrangement satisfies the condition that each person shakes hands with at least one other person and results in a total of 23 handshakes.\nThe next step is: Each person shakes hands with two other people, so the total number of handshakes is 23.\nThis arrangement satisfies the condition that each person shakes hands with at least one other person and results in a total of 22 handshakes.\nEach person still shakes hands with two other people, so the total number of handshakes is 23.\nEach person still shakes hands with two other people, so the total number of handshakes is 23.",
