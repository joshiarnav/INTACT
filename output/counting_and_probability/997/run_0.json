    "solution": "The first three-digit positive integer that is a multiple of 11 is 110, which is $11\\times 10$.  The last is 990, which is $11\\times 90$.  So, the number of three-digit multiples of 11 is the same as the number of numbers in the list $10, 11, 12, \\ldots, 90$, which is $90-10+1 = \\boxed{81}$.",
