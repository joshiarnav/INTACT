Also, thanks to SAS Similarity (or AA also works), we see that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle ADE.$ That means that $ABC$ is also a $3:4:5$ triangle. Since $AB = 9,$ that means that $AC = 15$ and $BC = 12.$\n\nWe find the shaded area of $BCED$ by subtracting the areas of $ABC$ and $ADE.$ The area of $ABC$ is simply $\\dfrac{9 \\cdot 12}{2} = 54,$ and the area of $ADE$ is $\\dfrac{6 \\cdot 8}{2} = 24.$ Therefore, our desired area is $54 - 24 = \\boxed{30} \\text{ cm}^2.$",
