    "solution": "Name the vertices of the hexagon so that hexagon $ABCDEF$ has $AB=1$, $BC=7$, $CD=2$, and $DE=4$.  The hexagon is equiangular, so each interior angle measures $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees.  Extend sides $AB$, $CD$, and $EF$ and call their intersection points $G$, $H$, and $J$ as shown.  The exterior angles of the hexagon each measure $180-120=60$ degrees, so triangles $JDE$, $CBH$, $FGA$, and $JHG$ are all equilateral.  It follows that $JD=DE=4$ units and $CH=CB=7$ units.  Therefore the side length $JH$ of triangle $JGH$ is $4+2+7=13$ units.  Turning to side $HG$, we find that $AF=AG=13-(7+1)=5$ units.  Finally, we solve $JG=JE+EF+FG$ for $EF$ to get $EF=13-(4+5)=4$ units.  The sum of the missing sides is $5+4=\\boxed{9}$ units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(6cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=4;\n\npair A=(8,0), B=(7,0), C=7*dir(60), D=9*dir(60), Ep=(13,0)+9*dir(120), F=(13,0)+5*dir(120), G=(13,0), H=(0,0), J=13*dir(60);\n\npair[] dots = {A, B, C, D, Ep, F};\n\ndot(dots);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--Ep--F--cycle);\n\ndraw(B--H--C,dashed);\ndraw(D--J--Ep,dashed);\ndraw(F--G--A,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,NW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NW);\nlabel(\"$E$\",Ep,NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,NE);\nlabel(\"$G$\",G,SE);\nlabel(\"$H$\",H,SW);\nlabel(\"$J$\",J,N);\n\nlabel(\"$1$\",(A+B)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$7$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$2$\",(C+D)/2,SE);\nlabel(\"$4$\",(D+Ep)/2,S);\n[/asy]",
