    "solution": "We have $\\angle CBD = 90^\\circ - \\angle A = 60^\\circ$, so $\\triangle BDC$ and $\\triangle CDA$ are similar 30-60-90 triangles.  Side $\\overline{CD}$ of $\\triangle BCD$ corresponds to $\\overline{AD}$ of $\\triangle CAD$ (each is opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle), so the ratio of corresponding sides in these triangles is $\\frac{CD}{AD}$.  From 30-60-90 triangle $ACD$, this ratio equals $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.  The ratio of the areas of these triangles equals the square of the ratio of the corresponding sides, or \\[\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac13}.\\]",
