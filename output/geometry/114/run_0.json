    "solution": "We're given that $\\triangle ABQ \\sim \\triangle QCP$ and thus $m\\angle B = m\\angle C.$ Therefore, $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles. From the given $m\\angle BAC=70^\\circ$, we have that $m\\angle ABC = m\\angle BCA = 55^\\circ$.  But we also know that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle PAQ$, which means that $m\\angle PAQ=55^\\circ$ as well.  Subtracting, $m\\angle BAQ=15^\\circ$.  Finally, from similar triangles, we have $m\\angle PQC=m\\angle BAQ = \\boxed{15^\\circ}$.",
