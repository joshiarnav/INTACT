    "problem": "A recipe for crispy rice treats results in a mixture that fills a 9-inch by 13-inch pan to a depth of one inch. If a crispy rice treats mixture resulting from 1.5 times the original recipe is poured into a pan that is 10 inches by 15 inches, to what depth, in inches, will the pan be filled? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The volume of crispy rice treats resulting from the original recipe is $9\\cdot 13\\cdot 1 = 117$ cubic inches.  Thus the volume obtained by making 1.5 times the original recipe is $1.5\\cdot 117 =175.5$ cubic inches.  So the depth to which the pan is filled is $\\frac{175.5}{10\\cdot 15} = \\boxed{1.17}$ inches.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  The original recipe fills a 9-inch by 13-inch pan to a depth of one inch. We need to find the volume of the mixture produced by the original recipe.\nVolume of original recipe = (9) * (13) * (1) = 117 cubic inches\nStep 2:  The mixture resulting from 1.5 times the original recipe will have a volume of 1.5 times the volume of the original recipe.\nVolume of 1.5 times the original recipe = 1.5 * (9) * (13) * (1) = 1.5 * 117 = 176.5 cubic inches\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the depth to which a pan of dimensions 10 inches by 15 inches will be filled with the 176.5 cubic inches of mixture. Let's denote the depth as \"d\". The volume of the mixture in the new pan is given by (10) * (15) * d. We already know that the volume of the mixture is 176.5 cubic inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (10) * (15) * d = 176.5. We can solve for d: d = 176.5 / ((10) * (15)) = 176.5 / 150 = 1.174\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1.17}$.",
