    "solution": "We draw a regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ as shown below.  The desired distance can be measured by diagonal $AC$: [asy]\n\nsize(120);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\ndraw(E--C);\n\nlabel(\"$6$\",(A+B)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",C,NW);label(\"$B$\",D,W);label(\"$C$\",E,SW);label(\"$D$\",F,SE);label(\"$E$\",A,ENE);label(\"$F$\",B,NE);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy] To compute the length of $AC$, we let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$: [asy]\n\nsize(120);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\ndraw(E--C);\n\nlabel(\"$6$\",(A+B)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",C,NW);label(\"$B$\",D,W);label(\"$C$\",E,SW);label(\"$D$\",F,SE);label(\"$E$\",A,ENE);label(\"$F$\",B,NE);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A); pair H=(E+C)/2; draw(D--H); label(\"$H$\",H,ENE);\n[/asy] Since the hexagon is regular, $\\angle ABC = 120^\\circ$ and $\\angle ABH = \\angle CBH = 120^\\circ / 2 = 60^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\triangle ABH$ and $\\triangle CBH$ are congruent $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangles.  These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince $AB=BC=6$, we have $BH = AB/2 = 3$ and $AH = CH = \\sqrt{6^2-3^2} = \\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $BH$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangle is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $AC = 2\\cdot 3\\sqrt{3} = 6\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus, any pair of parallel sides in this regular hexagon are $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}$ units apart.",
