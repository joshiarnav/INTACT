    "solution": "Let $O$ be the center of the circle.  The sum of the angles in pentagon $ABCDO$ is $3 (180^\\circ) = 540^\\circ.$ Since $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle BCD$ are interior angles of a regular pentagon, they each measure $108^\\circ.$ The given circle is tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $A$ and to $\\overline{CD}$ at $D,$ and so it follows that $\\angle OAB = \\angle ODC = 90^\\circ.$ Then \\[\\begin{aligned} \\angle AOD &= 540^\\circ - \\angle ABC - \\angle BCD - \\angle OAB - \\angle ODC \\\\ &=  540^\\circ - 2 (108^\\circ) - 2 (90^\\circ) = 144^\\circ. \\end{aligned}\\]Thus, the measure of minor arc $AD$ is also $\\boxed{144^\\circ}.$\n[asy]size(4cm);pair A=dir(-108),B=dir(-36),C=dir(36),D=dir(108),E=dir(180),O=extension(D,dir(-90)*(C-D)+D,A,dir(90)*(B-A)+A);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--cycle ^^ Circle(O, abs(O-D)) ^^ A--O--D);\ndot(\"$A$\",A,SE);\ndot(\"$B$\",B,SE);\ndot(\"$C$\",C,NE);\ndot(\"$D$\",D,NE);\ndot(\"$E$\",E,W);\ndot(\"$O$\",O,dir(0));\n[/asy]",
