    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If the base of a pyramid has $n$ sides, then the pyramid has $n$ edges on the base and $n$ edges connecting the base vertices to the apex (a total of $2n$ edges). The base has $n$ vertices and the apex is a vertex, so there are $n+1$ vertices. If a pyramid has $14$ edges, then $n=\\frac{14}{2}=7$ and there are $n+1=\\boxed{8}$ vertices.",

Use Euler's formula to write an equation involving $v$ and $e$: $v-e+f=2$.\nStep 2: Since the given polyhedron is a pyramid, its faces are a combination of triangles and the base. If the base is a triangle, then the pyramid has $4$ triangular faces. So, the number of faces $f=4$. Substitute $f$ and $e=14$ into the equation from Step 1 and solve for $v$: $v-14+4=2$\nStep 3: \n$v=12$\nStep 4: No additional steps are required since the value of v has already been determined in Step 3.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
