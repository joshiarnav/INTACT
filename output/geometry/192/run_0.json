    "solution": "Connecting the midpoints of the sides of a square in order forms a square that has half the area of the original square.  So, the square formed by connecting the midpoints of $ABCD$ has area $\\frac12\\cdot 4^2 = 8$ square inches.  The smallest square in the diagram is formed by connecting the midpoints of this square with area 8, so the smallest square has area $\\frac12 \\cdot 8 =4$ square inches, leaving $8-4=\\boxed{4}$ square inches of shaded area.",
