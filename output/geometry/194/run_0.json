    "problem": "A right square pyramid has a base with edges each measuring 3 cm and a height twice the perimeter of its base. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The perimeter of the base is $4\\cdot 3 = 12$ cm, so the height of the pyramid is $2\\cdot 12 = 24$ cm.  The base has area $3^2 = 9$ square cm.  The volume of the pyramid is one-third the product of the area of the base and the altitude, which is $9\\cdot 24/3=\\boxed{72}$ cubic cm.",
