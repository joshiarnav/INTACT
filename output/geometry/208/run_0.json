All four triangles are isosceles right triangles, so we can find their leg lengths and areas.  The triangle with $A$ as a vertex has leg length $4/\\sqrt{2}=2\\sqrt{2}$ and area $(1/2)(2\\sqrt{2})^2=4$.  Similarly, the triangles with $B$, $C$, and $D$ as a vertex have leg lengths $\\sqrt{2}$, $2\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\sqrt{2}$ respectively, and areas $1$, $4$, and $1$ respectively.\n\nNow we can compute the sides of rectangle $ABCD$. $AB=2\\sqrt{2}+1+\\sqrt{2}=1+3\\sqrt{2}$ and $CB=\\sqrt{2}+2+2\\sqrt{2}=2+3\\sqrt{2}$.  It follows that the area of $ABCD$ is \\[(1+3\\sqrt{2})(2+3\\sqrt{2})=20+9\\sqrt{2}.\\]Finally, the area of the octagon is $20+9\\sqrt{2}-1-4-1-4=\\boxed{10+9\\sqrt{2}}$.",
