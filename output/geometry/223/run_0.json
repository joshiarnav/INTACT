    "problem": "The diameter of a cone is 30 decimeters. If the height is two times the radius, what is the volume of the cone in cubic decimeters?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If the diameter of the cone is $30$ decimeters, then the radius is $r=30/2=15$ decimeters. The height is two times the radius, so the height is $h=30$ decimeters. The volume of the cones is $\\frac13 (\\pi r^2) h = \\frac13 (\\pi 15^2) \\cdot 30 = \\boxed{2250\\pi}$ cubic decimeters.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let r be the radius of the cone, and h be its height. Since the diameter is 30 decimeters, the radius is half of that, so r = 15 decimeters. The height of the cone is two times the radius, so h = 2r = 2(15) = 30 decimeters.\nStep 2: The volume of a cone is given by the formula V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h. Substituting the values of r and h into the formula, we get V = (1/3)\u03c0(15)\u00b2(30).\nV = (1/3) \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 225 \u00d7 30\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2250\u03c0.",
