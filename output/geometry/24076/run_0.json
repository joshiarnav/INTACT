    "solution": "Since $XY=YZ,$ then $\\triangle XYZ$ is isosceles. Draw altitude $YW$ from $Y$ to $W$ on $XZ.$ Altitude $YW$ bisects the base $XZ$ so that $$XW=WZ=\\frac{30}{2}=15,$$as shown.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(30,0)--(15,-8)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((15,0)--(15,-8),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\ndraw((15,0)--(15,-1)--(14,-1)--(14,0)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$X$\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"$Y$\",(15,-8),S);\nlabel(\"$Z$\",(30,0),E);\nlabel(\"$W$\",(15,0),N);\nlabel(\"17\",(0,0)--(15,-8),SW);\nlabel(\"17\",(15,-8)--(30,0),SE);\nlabel(\"15\",(0,0)--(15,0),N);\nlabel(\"15\",(15,0)--(30,0),N);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle YWX=90^{\\circ},$ $\\triangle YWX$ is right angled. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $17^2=YW^2+15^2$ or $YW^2=17^2-15^2$ or $YW^2=289-225=64,$ and so $YW=\\sqrt{64}=8,$ since $YW>0.$\n\nWe rotate $\\triangle XWY$ clockwise $90^{\\circ}$ about $W$ and similarly rotate $\\triangle ZWY$ counter-clockwise $90^{\\circ}$ about $W$ to obtain a new isosceles triangle with the same area. The new triangle formed has two equal sides of length $17$ (since $XY$ and $ZY$ form these sides) and a third side having length twice that of $YW$ or $2\\times8=16$ (since the new base consists of two copies of $YW$).\n\nTherefore, the desired perimeter is $17+17+16= \\boxed{50}.$",
