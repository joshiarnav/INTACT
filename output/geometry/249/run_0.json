Draw line $XC$, which divides the shaded region into two equal shaded regions, one blue and one grey.  We will calculate the area of the blue region and multiply it by 2 to yield the total shaded area.\n\nTo calculate the area of the blue region, notice that it is equal to the area of the quarter circle bounded by arc $CX$, centered at $Y$, minus the area of triangle $\\triangle CXY$.  The quarter circle has radius $8/2=4$ and area \\[\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\pi (4)^2 = 4\\pi.\\]The triangle has area \\[\\frac{1}{2} (4)(4) = 8.\\]Hence the blue region has area $4\\pi - 8$.  The entire shaded region has area twice this, which is $2(4\\pi-8) = \\boxed{8\\pi - 16}$.",
