    "problem": "A particular cubic box has edge length two inches. If the box has no top, what is the external surface area of the box?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The box has five square faces, each of which has edge length 2 inches.  Hence each square has an area of 4 square inches, and our total area is $5\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{20}$ square inches.",
