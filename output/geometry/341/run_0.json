    "solution": "Since $\\angle{Z}$ is the right angle, our triangle is shown below:\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(7,0)--(7,24)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));\ndraw(rightanglemark((0,0),(7,0),(7,24),30),black+linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$X$\",(7,24),E);\nlabel(\"$Y$\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"$Z$\",(7,0),E);\nlabel(\"25\",(0,0)--(7,24),NW);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\cos{Y}=\\frac{7}{25}$, we have $\\cos{Y}=\\frac{YZ}{XY}=\\frac{YZ}{25}=\\frac{7}{25}$.  From this, we can see that $YZ=25\\cdot\\frac{7}{25}=7$.  Then, from the Pythagorean Theorem, $XZ=\\sqrt{XY^2-YZ^2}=\\sqrt{25^2-7^2}=\\sqrt{576}=24$.  Finally, we have $\\tan{X}=\\frac{YZ}{XZ}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{24}}$.",

The Pythagorean Theorem states that for any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. So, $XZ^2=XY^2-YZ^2=25^2-7^2=625-49=576$.
