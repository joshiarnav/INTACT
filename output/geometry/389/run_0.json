    "solution": "We try splitting the quadrilateral into two triangles by drawing the segment $\\overline{YW}$. We see that $\\triangle YZW$ is a right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the length of the hypotenuse, or we notice that $24$ and $32$ are part of a multiple of the Pythagorean triple $(3,4,5)$: $8(3,4,5)=(24,32,40)$. So the length of the hypotenuse if $\\triangle YZW$ is a right triangle is $40$ units. Now we look at $\\triangle XYW$ to see if it is also a right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the leg $\\overline{YW}$, or we see if $96$ and $104$ are part of a multiple of a Pythagorean triple. We have $\\frac{96}{104}=\\frac{2^5\\cdot3}{2^3\\cdot13}=2^3\\left(\\frac{2^2\\cdot3}{13}\\right)=8\\left(\\frac{12}{13}\\right)$. So we have a multiple of the Pythagorean triple $(5,12,13)$: $8(5,12,13)=(40, 96, 104)$. Notice that both triangles give us $YW=40$, so we can safely assume that they are right triangles and the assumption is consistent with the drawing. In a right triangle, the base and height are the two legs, so the area of $\\triangle YZW$ is $\\frac12(32)(24)=384$ and the area of $\\triangle XYW$ is $\\frac12(96)(40)=1920$. The area of the quadrilateral is the sum of the areas of the two triangles, so the area of the quadrilateral is $1920+384=\\boxed{2304}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(200); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\npair X = (0,0), Y = 96*dir(45), Z = (Y.x + 32, Y.y), W = (Z.x,Z.y - 24);\ndraw(X--Y--Z--W--cycle);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,SW); label(\"$Y$\",Y,NW); label(\"$Z$\",Z,NE); label(\"$W$\",W,SE); label(\"96\",X--Y,NW); label(\"104\",X--W,SE); label(\"24\",Z--W,E); label(\"32\",Y--Z,N);\ndraw(Y--W);\ndraw(rightanglemark(Y,Z,W,100));\ndraw(rightanglemark(X,Y,W,100));\nlabel(\"40\", Y--W, SW);\n[/asy]",
