    "problem": "By how many degrees does the measure of an interior angle of a regular octagon exceed the measure of an interior angle of a regular hexagon?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The sum of the angle measures in a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  So, the sum of the octagon's angles is $180(8-2) = 1080$ degrees.  The polygon is regular, so all the angles have the same measure, which means each is $\\frac{1080^\\circ}{8} = 135^\\circ$.  Similarly, the sum of the angles of a hexagon is $180(6-2) = 720$ degrees, which means each angle in a regular hexagon has measure $\\frac{720^\\circ}{6} = 120^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the desired difference is $135^\\circ - 120^\\circ = \\boxed{15^\\circ}$.",
