    "problem": "In a regular polygon, the measure of an interior angle is 6.5 times the measure of an exterior angle. How many sides does the polygon have?",

    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The measure of an interior angle of a regular $n$-gon is $\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$ degrees and the measure of an exterior angle is $\\frac{360}{n}$ degrees.  Solving  \\[\n\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}=6.5\\cdot\\left(\\frac{360}{n}\\right),\n\\] we find $n=\\boxed{15}$.",

The measure of the corresponding interior angle is 6.5x. According to Step 1, x + 6.5x = 180.\nStep 3: Combine like terms to get 7.5x = 180.\nStep 4: Solve for x to get x = 24.\nStep 5: The sum of the measures of the exterior angles of a polygon is always 360 degrees. Since there are n sides, the sum of the measures of the exterior angles is also n times x. So, n times x = 360. Substitute x = 24 into the equation to get 24n = 360.\nDivide both sides of the equation 24n = 360 by 24 to solve for n.\nStep 6: n = 360 \u00f7 24 = 15\nStep 7: \n\\frac{360}{24}=15\nStep 8: \nn = 360 \u00f7 24 = 15\nStep 7: n = 360 \u00f7 15 = 24",
