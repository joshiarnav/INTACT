    "solution": "We know that $OA$ and $OB$ are each radii of the semi-circle with center $O$. Thus, $OA=OB=OC+CB=32+36=68$. Therefore, $AC=AO+OC=68+32=100$.\n\nThe semi-circle with center $K$ has radius $AK=\\frac{1}{2}(AC)=\\frac{1}{2}(100)=50$.\n\nThe shaded area is equal to the area of the largest semi-circle with center $O$, minus the combined areas of the two smaller unshaded semi-circles with centers $K$ and $M$.  The radius of the smaller unshaded circle is $MB=\\frac{1}{2}(CB)=\\frac{1}{2}(36)=18$.  Therefore, the shaded area equals \\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(OB)^2-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(AK)^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(MB)^2\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(68)^2-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(50)^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(18)^2\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(68^2-50^2-18^2)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(4624-2500-324)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(1800)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{900\\pi}\n\\end{align*}",
