We can do this by finding the distance from the center of the circle, point C, to any point on the circle, such as (8, 1).\nStep 3:  The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the distance formula: d = \u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).\nStep 4:  In this case, the center of the circle is at (3, 1) and the point on the circle is (8, 1).\nStep 5:  We can use the distance formula to find the distance between these two points, which will give us the radius of the circle.
