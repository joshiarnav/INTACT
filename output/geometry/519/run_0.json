    "problem": "Two intersecting circles have a common chord of length 16 ft, and their centers lie on opposite sides of the chord. The radii of the circles are 10 ft and 17 ft respectively. Express the distance between the centers of the circles in feet.",

    "solution": "We first draw out the figure described in this problem and label the important points with circle $A$ having radius $10$ ft and circle $B$ having radius $17$ feet: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt));\n\ndraw(Circle((10,17),10));\ndraw(Circle((31,17),17));\ndraw((16,25)--(16,9));\ndraw((10,17)--(31,17)--(16,9)--cycle);\ndraw((14.5,17)--(14.5,15.5)--(17.5,15.5)--(17.5,17),linewidth(.7));\ndot((10,17),linewidth(3));\ndot((16,25),linewidth(3));\ndot((31,17),linewidth(3));\ndot((16,9),linewidth(3));\ndot((16,17),linewidth(3));\nlabel(\"A\",(10,17),NW);\nlabel(\"D\",(16,25),N);\nlabel(\"B\",(31,17),NE);\nlabel(\"C\",(16,9),S);\nlabel(\"E\",(16,17),NE);\n[/asy] Since $\\overline{AC}$ is a radius of circle $A$ and $\\overline{BC}$ is a radius of circle $B$, we have that $AC=10$ and $BC=17$. Also, since $\\overline{DC}$ is a common chord to the two circles, line segment $\\overline{AB}$, which connects the centers of the two circles, must both bisect $\\overline{DC}$ and be perpendicular to it. We'll call the point of intersection of these two lines point $E$ and since $DC=16$, $\\overline{EC}$ must have length $8$.\n\nNow we notice that we have two right triangles $\\triangle AEC$ and $\\triangle BEC$. Since we know the lengths of $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{EC}$, we can find the length of $\\overline{AE}$ using the Pythagorean Theorem:  \\begin{align*}\n& AE^2 + EC^2 = AC^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad & AE = \\sqrt{10^2-8^2}=6\n\\end{align*}  Similarly, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find that the length of $\\overline{EB}$ is $\\sqrt{17^2-8^2}=15$. The length of $\\overline{AB}$, the distance between the two centers of the circles, must be the sum of the lengths of $\\overline{AE}$ and $\\overline{EB}$, which is $6+15=\\boxed{21}$ feet.",
