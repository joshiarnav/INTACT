    "problem": "A rectangular pool is $6\\text{ m}$ wide, $12\\text{ m}$ long and $4\\text{ m}$ deep. If the pool is half full of water, what is the volume of water in the pool?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since the pool has dimensions $6\\text{ m}$ by $12\\text{ m}$ by $4\\text{ m},$ then its total volume is $6 \\times 12 \\times 4 = 288 \\mbox{ m}^3.$\n\nSince the pool is only half full of water, then the volume of water in the pool is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 288 \\mbox{ m}^3$ or $\\boxed{144 \\mbox{ m}^3}.$",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the volume of water in the pool when it is half full. The formula to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is $V = lwh$, where $l$ is the length, $w$ is the width, and $h$ is the height of the prism.\nStep 2: Since the pool is half full, we need to find the volume of water in half the depth of the pool. We can find this by multiplying the length, width, and half the height of the pool.\nStep 3: Calculate the volume of water in the pool by substituting the given values into the formula, $V = (6\\text{ m})(12\\text{ m})\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 4\\text{ m}\\right)$.\nStep 4: Perform the arithmetic $V = (6\\text{ m})(12\\text{ m})\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 4\\text{ m}\\right) = (72)\\left(2\\right) = 144\\text{ m}^3$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{144}$",
