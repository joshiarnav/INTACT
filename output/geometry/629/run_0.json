Let $C$ and $D$ be the points of intersection of the circles of radius 1 centered at $A$ and $B$.

Thus the sector bounded by $\\overline{BC}$, $\\overline{BD}$, and arc $CAD$ has area $\\pi/3$, as does the sector bounded by $\\overline{AC}$, $\\overline{AD}$, and arc $CBD$. The intersection of the two sectors, which is the union of the two triangles, has area $\\sqrt{3}/2$, so the area of $R$ is \\[\n\\frac{2\\pi}{3}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\n\\][asy]\nunitsize(3cm);\nlabel(\"Region $R$\",(-0.87,0.5),NW);\ndraw((-0.87,0.5)..(-0.5,0.87)--(-1,0)..cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-0.87,-0.5)..(-0.5,-0.87)--(-1,0)..cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-0.13,0.5)..(-0.5,0.87)--(0,0)..cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-0.13,-0.5)..(-0.5,-0.87)--(0,0)..cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-1,0)--(0,0),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"1\",(-0.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-1,0),W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,0),E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-0.5,0.87),N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(-0.5,-0.87),S);\n[/asy]\n\nThe region $S$ consists of all points within 1 unit of $R$.
