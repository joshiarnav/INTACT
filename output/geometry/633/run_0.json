    "solution": "Let $A,B$ be the areas of the semicircles on the legs of the right triangle, and let $C$ be the area of the semicircle on the hypotenuse of the right triangle.  Then we see that by Pythagorean theorem $A + B = C$.\n\nThe area of the triangle plus the area of the two small semicircles is\n\\[A + B + \\frac{6 \\cdot 8}{2} = A + B + 24.\\]But this is also the area we are interested in, plus $C.$  Therefore, the answer is $A + B + 24 - C = \\boxed{24}.$",

To approach this, we first need to calculate the area of the shaded region, which is a semicircle with a radius equal to the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle.\nStep 2:  To find the area of the shaded region, we can use the formula for the area of a semicircle, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the semicircle.\nStep 3:  We know that the hypotenuse of the right triangle has a length of 10 units, so the radius of the shaded semicircle is also 10 units. Substituting this into the formula gives us an area of $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi (10^2) = 50\\pi$ square units for the shaded region.\nStep 4:  Now that we have the area of the shaded region, we can find the areas of the semicircles on the legs of the triangle. The semicircles on the legs have radii of 6 and 8 units\nStep 2:  The areas of the semicircles on the legs of the triangle can be calculated as $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi (6^2) = 18\\pi$ and $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi (8^2) = 32\\pi$ square units, respectively.\nStep 3:  The total shaded area is $50\\pi$ square units.
