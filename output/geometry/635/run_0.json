    "solution": "The area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{(b_1+b_2)h}{2}$. This trapezoid has bases of $2$ and $8$ units and a height of $3$ units, so the area is $\\frac{(2+8)3}{2}=\\boxed{15}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "The formula for the area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{h}{2}\\left(b_{1}+b_{2}\\right)$, where $h$ is the height of the trapezoid, and $b_{1}$ and $b_{2}$ are the lengths of the bases.\nStep 1:  The height of the trapezoid is the distance between the bases, which are $\\overline{OB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$. The y-coordinates of the points $O$ and $C$ are $0$ and $3$, respectively, so the height is $3-0=3$.\n \nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
