    "problem": "A triangle with sides measuring 8, 15 and 17 units is inscribed in a circle. What is the radius of the circle, in units? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "An $8-15-17$ triangle is always right. It follows that the hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle, and the radius must be half the hypotenuse, or $\\frac{17}{2} = \\boxed{8.5}$.",
