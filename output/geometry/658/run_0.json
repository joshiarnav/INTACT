    "problem": "How many inches are in the circumference of a great circle of a sphere which has surface area of $196\\pi$ sq in? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the sphere.",

    "solution": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[4\\pi r^2 = 196\\pi.\\] Dividing both sides by $4\\pi$ yields $r^2 = 49$; taking the square root of both sides and keeping the positive solution yields $r=7$ inches.\n\nA great circle of a sphere is the circular cross-section of the sphere that passes through the sphere's center, which, in this case, is a circle with radius 7.  The circumference of this circle is $2\\pi\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{14\\pi}$ inches.",

Solving for $r$, we get $r^2 = 49$, which gives us $r = 7$.\nStep 4:  The circumference of a circle is given by $2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Since we're looking for the circumference of the great circle of the sphere, we'll use this formula to find the circumference using the radius found in step 3.\nStep 4: The circumference of the great circle of the sphere is $2\\pi r = 2\\pi(7)$.\nStep 5: $2\\pi(7) = 14\\pi$\nThe circumference of the great circle of the sphere is $2\\pi r = 2\\pi(7)$.\n$2\\pi(7) = 14\\pi$\n$2\\pi(7) = 14\\pi$\n$2\\pi(7) = 14\\pi$",
