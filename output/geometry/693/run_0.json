    "solution": "We first label the trapezoid $ABCD$ as shown in the diagram below. Since $AD$ is the height of the trapezoid, then $AB$ and $DC$ are parallel. The area of the trapezoid is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{AD}{2}\\times(AB+DC)&=\\frac{12}{2}\\times(AB+16) \\\\\n&=6\\times(AB+16).\n\\end{align*} Since the area of the trapezoid is $162,$  we have $6\\times(AB+16)=162$ so that $$AB+16=\\frac{162}{6}.$$ Solving for $AB$, we obtain $AB=11.$\n\nConstruct a perpendicular from $B$ to $E$ on $DC.$ Since $AB$ and $DE$ are parallel, and both $AD$ and $BE$ are perpendicular to $DE,$ we know that $ABED$ is a rectangle. Thus, $DE=AB=11,$ $BE=AD=12,$ and \\begin{align*}\nEC&=DC-DE \\\\\n&=16-11 \\\\\n&=5.\n\\end{align*} Since $\\angle BEC=90^{\\circ},$ we know that $\\triangle BEC$ is a right triangle. Thus by the Pythagorean Theorem, \\begin{align*}\nBC^2&=BE^2+EC^2 \\\\\n&= 12^2+5^2 \\\\\n&= 169\n\\end{align*} so that $BC=13$ (since $BC>0$).\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezoid is $$AB+BC+CD+DA=11+13+16+12=\\boxed{52}\\text{ cm}.$$ [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(0,12)--(11,12)--(16,0)--cycle);\ndraw((11,0)--(11,12),dashed);\ndraw((11.7,0)--(11.7,.7)--(11,.7));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,12),NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(11,12),NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(16,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(11,0),S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"12 cm\",(-1,6),W);\nlabel(\"16 cm\",(8,-1),S);\n[/asy]",
