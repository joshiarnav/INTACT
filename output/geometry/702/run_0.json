The  distance between $C$ and $D$ is 140 m.  A hot-air balloon is positioned in the air at $H$ directly above $O$. The balloon is held in place by four ropes $HA$, $HB$, $HC$, and $HD$.

Then $CP=140-a$.\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem in $\\triangle HPC$, $x^2 + (140-a)^2 = 150^2$.\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem in $\\triangle HPD$, $x^2+a^2 = 130^2$.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we obtain \\begin{align*}\n(140-a)^2 - a^2 & = 150^2 - 130^2 \\\\\n(19600 - 280a+a^2)-a^2 & = 5600 \\\\\n19600 -280a & = 5600 \\\\\n280a & = 14000 \\\\\na & = 50\n\\end{align*} Therefore, $x^2 + 90^2 = 150^2$ or $x^2 = 150^2 - 90^2 = 22500 - 8100 = 14400$ so $x =120$.\nSo the shortest possible rope that we can use is 120 m, which saves $130+150-120 = \\boxed{160}$ m of rope.",
