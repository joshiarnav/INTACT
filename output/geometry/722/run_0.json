    "solution": "We begin by drawing a diagram and labeling the vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$ as shown:\n\n[asy]\npair A, B, C;\nA=(0,0); B=(17,0); C=(5,12);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$B$\",B,E); label(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$13$\",(A+C)/2,NW); label(\"$12\\sqrt{2}$\",(B+C)/2,NE); label(\"$17$\",(A+B)/2,S);\n[/asy]\n\nWe drop a perpendicular from $C$ to $\\overline{AB}$ and label the intersection point $X$. $X$ divides $AB$ into two segments $AX$ and $XB$ that sum to 17, so let $AX=x$ and $XB=17-x$.  Let the height of the triangle, $CX$, have length $h$.\n\n[asy]\npair A, B, C, X;\nA=(0,0); B=(17,0); C=(5,12); X=(5,0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(C--X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$B$\",B,E); label(\"$C$\",C,N); label(\"$X$\",X,S);\nlabel(\"$13$\",(A+C)/2,NW); label(\"$12\\sqrt{2}$\",(B+C)/2,NE); label(\"$x$\",(A+X)/2,S); label(\"$17-x$\",(B+X)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$h$\",(C+X)/2,E);\ndraw(rightanglemark(C,X,B,20));\n[/asy]\n\nNow we have two right triangles, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem on both triangles to write two equations in terms of $x$ and $h$.  From $\\triangle AXC$, we have \\[x^2+h^2=13^2,\\] and from $\\triangle CXB$, we have \\[(17-x)^2+h^2=(12\\sqrt{2})^2.\\] Expanding the second equation gives $289-34x+x^2+h^2=144\\cdot 2 = 288$; substituting the first equation into the second gives \\[289-34x+13^2=288.\\] Simplifying and solving for $x$ yields $1+169=34x$, so $x=170/34=5$.  Plugging this value into the first equation gives \\[h^2=13^2-x^2=169-25=144,\\] so $h=\\sqrt{144}=12$.  Finally, we can compute the area of $\\triangle ABC$ to be \\[\\frac{1}{2}(AB)(h)=\\frac{1}{2}(17)(12)=\\boxed{102}.\\]",
