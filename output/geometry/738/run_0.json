    "solution": "The region bounded by these lines is a right-isosceles triangle with legs along the $x$ and $y$ axes.  The length of these legs are given by the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line which are both 6.  Thus the area of this region is $\\frac 12 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{18}$ square units.",
