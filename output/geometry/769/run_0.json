    "solution": "Since $AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2$, triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with right angle at $\\angle B$.  The circumcenter of a right triangle is the midpoint of the hypotenuse of the triangle.  So, the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$ is the center of the circle, and the radius is $AC/2 = \\boxed{\\frac{17}{2}}$.",
