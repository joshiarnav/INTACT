We are asked to find the ratio of the area of triangle $ACE$ to the area of rectangle $ABDE$. \nStep 2:  To start, we should identify the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle and triangle. The vertices of triangle $ACE$ are given as $A(1, 1)$, $C(3, 3)$ and $E(4, 1)$.\nStep 3:  We need to extend the figure to include the rectangle $ABDE$, which will help us in determining the coordinates of the other vertices.\nStep 4:  Based on the given information, we can extend the line segment $AE$ downward to the $x$-axis to complete the rectangle $ABDE$. This means the point $F$ has coordinates $(4,0)$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, the line segment $BD$ extends to the right to complete the rectangle. The point $G$ has coordinates $(4,3)$.\nStep 6:  With the entire rectangle and triangle drawn, we can now calculate the areas of both shapes\nStep 7:\nThe area of the rectangle $ABDE$ is calculated as the product of its length and width, which gives us $3 \\times 3 = 9$ square units.\nThe area of triangle $ACE$ is found using the formula for the area of a triangle: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times$ base $\\times$ height.
