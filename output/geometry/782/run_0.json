    "solution": "The angles of a regular $n$-gon have measure $\\left(\\frac{180(n-2)}n\\right)^\\circ$.  Therefore the angles in a regular decagon measure \\[y=\\frac{180\\cdot8}{10}=144\\]degrees.\n\nWe also note that since the larger angles of the quadrilateral are equal, and the three corresponding sides are equal, this is an isosceles trapezoid. Therefore we get the following angles:\n\n[asy]\nimport markers;\nfor(int i=0; i <=10; ++i) {\ndraw(dir(360*i/10+90)--dir(360*(i+1)/10+90));\n}\npair A = dir(360*0/10+90);\npair F = dir(360*7/10+90);\npair G = dir(360*8/10+90);\npair H = dir(360*9/10+90);\n\ndraw(A--F);\n\nmarkangle(Label(\"$x$\",Relative(0.5)),n=1,radius=13,G,F,A);\nmarkangle(Label(\"$x$\",Relative(0.5)),n=1,radius=13,F,A,H);\nmarkangle(Label(\"$y$\",Relative(0.5)),n=1,radius=9,A,H,G);\nmarkangle(Label(\"$y$\",Relative(0.5)),n=1,radius=9,H,G,F);\n\n[/asy]\n\nThe sum of the angle measures in a quadrilateral is always $360^\\circ$, so we have  \\[360=x+x+y+y=x+x+144+144.\\]Therefore  \\[x+x=360-144-144=72\\]degrees, so $x=\\boxed{36}$ degrees.",
