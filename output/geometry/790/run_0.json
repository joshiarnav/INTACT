    "solution": "Let the perpendiculars from $C$ and $D$ to $BE$ intersect $BE$ at $X$ and $Y$, respectively.  These perpendiculars split trapezoid $BCDE$ into two isosceles right triangles $\\triangle BCX$ and $\\triangle EDY$ and one rectangle $CDYX$.\n\nIn isosceles right triangles (which have angles 45-45-90), the ratio of the leg length to the hypotenuse length is $1:\\sqrt{2}$; hence, we have $BX=CX=DY=YE=12/\\sqrt{2}=6\\sqrt{2}$.  We also have $XY=CD=12$, as opposite sides of a rectangle are equal.\n\nThus, trapezoid $BCDE$ has bases of length $CD=12$ and $BE=6\\sqrt{2}+12+6\\sqrt{2}=12+12\\sqrt{2}$, and height of length $6\\sqrt{2}$.  Hence its area is $\\frac{1}{2}(12 + 12 + 12\\sqrt{2}) (6\\sqrt{2}) = \\boxed{72 + 72\\sqrt{2}}$.",
