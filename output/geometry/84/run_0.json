    "problem": "The radius of a right circular cylinder is decreased by $20\\%$ and its height is increased by $25\\%$. What is the absolute value of the percent change in the volume of the cylinder?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the original radius and height be $r$ and $h$ respectively, so the original volume is $\\pi r^2 h$.\n\nThe new radius and height are $\\frac{4}{5}r$ and $\\frac{5}{4}h$ respectively, so the new volume is $\\pi \\left(\\frac{4}{5}r\\right)^2 \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{4}{5} \\pi r^2 h$, which is $20\\%$ less than the original volume.\n\nHence the desired percent change is $\\boxed{20}$ percent.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let $r$ represent the original radius and $h$ represent the original height of the cylinder. The volume of the original cylinder is given by $V=\\pi r^{2}h$.\nStep 2: Let $r_1$ represent the new radius and $h_1$ represent the new height of the cylinder. The radius is decreased by $20\\%$, so the new radius is $r_{1}=0.8r$ and the height is increased by $25\\%$, so the new height is $h_{1}=1.25h$.\n\n Final Answer",
