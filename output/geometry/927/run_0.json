    "problem": "A cubic block of wood with side lengths of 10 cm is cut into smaller cubes with side lengths of 1 cm. What is the ratio of the surface area of the larger block of wood to the combined surface area of the smaller blocks of wood? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The large cube had a surface area of $6\\cdot10^2=600$ sq cm, and the smaller blocks have a total area of $6\\cdot1000=6000$ sq cm. The ratio is \\[\n\\frac{600}{6000}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}.\n\\]",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Find the surface area of the larger block of wood, which is a cube with side lengths of 10 cm. The formula for surface area of a cube is 6 * side^2.\nStep 2: Find the surface area of a single smaller cube with side lengths of 1 cm. The formula for surface area of a cube is 6 * side^2. Since there are 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000 smaller cubes, we must multiply the surface area of one smaller cube by 1000.\nStep 3: Divide the surface area of the larger block of wood by the combined surface area of the smaller blocks of wood to find the ratio.\nStep 2: Surface area of larger block = 6 * (10)^2 = 600 cm^2. Surface area of a single smaller cube = 6 * (1)^2 = 6 cm^2. Combined surface area of smaller blocks = 6 cm^2 * 1000 = 6000 cm^2.\nStep 3: Ratio = 600 cm^2 / 6000 cm^2 = 1/10.\nStep 4: Final Answer",
