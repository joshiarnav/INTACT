    "problem": "If the volume of a 2-cm-by-2cm-by-2cm cube is increased by 19 cubic centimeters to form a larger cube, what is the length in centimeters of one edge of the new cube?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The volume of the $2$-cm cube is $2^3=8$ cubic centimeters. The volume of the larger cube is $8+19=27$, so the length of one edge is $\\sqrt[3]{27}=\\boxed{3}$ cm.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the volume of the original cube.\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a cube is given by the formula \\( V = s^3 \\), where \\( s \\) is the length of one edge of the cube. For the original cube with a side length of 2 cm, the volume is calculated as \\( V = 2^3 = 8 \\) cubic centimeters.\nStep 2: Calculate the volume of the new cube.\nLet \\( x \\) be the length of one edge of the new cube. The volume of the new cube is given by \\( x^3 \\), and we know it is 19 cubic centimeters larger than the original cube's volume.
