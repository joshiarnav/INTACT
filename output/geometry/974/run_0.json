    "problem": "Two sides of a triangle have lengths of 18 and 29 units. If the third side has an integer length, what is the positive difference between the maximum and minimum length of the third side?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the third side have a length of $x$ units.  By the triangle inequality, $29<x+18$ and $x<18+29$.  Solving these two inequalities, we find $11<x<47$.  Therefore, the maximum and minimum integral values of $x$ are $46$ and $12$, respectively.  The difference between these two values is $46-12=\\boxed{34}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\nStep 2: The length of the third side must be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides but greater than the difference of the lengths of the other two sides: 29 - 18 < x < 18 + 29.\nStep 3: 29 - 18 < x < 18 + 29, which simplifies to 11 < x < 47.\nStep 4: The length of the third side must be an integer, so the possible values of x are 12, 13, 14, ..., 46.\nStep 5: The maximum value of x is 46 and the minimum value of x is 12, so the positive difference between the maximum and minimum length of the third side is 46 - 12 = 34.\nStep 6: 46 - 12 = 34.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{34}$",
