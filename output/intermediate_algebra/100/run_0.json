    "solution": "We seek to use Vieta's formulas. To be able to apply the formulas, we multiply both sides by $(x-1)(x-5)(x-10)(x-25)$ to eliminate the fractions. This gives \\[\\begin{aligned}&\\quad (x-5)(x-10)(x-25) + (x-1)(x-10)(x-25) \\\\& + (x-1)(x-5)(x-25) + (x-1)(x-5)(x-10) = 2(x-1)(x-5)(x-10)(x-25). \\end{aligned}\\](Be careful! We may have introduced one of the roots $x = 1, 5, 10, 25$ into this equation when we multiplied by $(x-1)(x-5)(x-10)(x-25).$ However, note that none of $x = 1, 5, 10, 25$ satisfy our new equation, since plugging each one in gives the false equation $1=0.$ Therefore, the roots of this new polynomial equation are the same as the roots of the original equation, and we may proceed.)\n\nThe left-hand side has degree $3$ while the right-hand side has degree $4,$ so when we move all the terms to the right-hand side, we will have a $4$th degree polynomial equation. To find the sum of the roots, it suffices to know the coefficients of $x^4$ and $x^3.$\n\nThe coefficient of $x^4$ on the right-hand side is $2,$ while the coefficients of $x^3$ on the left-hand and right-hand sides are $4$ and $2(-1-5-10-25) = -82,$ respectively. Therefore, when we move all the terms to the right-hand side, the resulting equation will be of the form \\[ 0 = 2x^4 - 86x^3 + \\cdots\\]It follows that the sum of the roots is $\\tfrac{86}{2} = \\boxed{43}.$",
