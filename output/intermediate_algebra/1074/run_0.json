    "problem": "What is the range of the function $g(x) = \\frac{3x+1}{x+8}$ ?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Solution #1\n\nTo determine the range, we suppose $y=\\frac{3x+1}{x+8}$ (where $x\\ne -8$) and see if we can solve for $x$:\n$$\\begin{array}{r r@{~=~}l}\n& y & (3x+1)/(x+8) \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & y(x + 8) & 3x + 1 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & yx + 8y & 3x + 1 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & x(y - 3) & 1 - 8y.\n\\end{array}$$This last equation gives a contradiction if $y=3$, since in this case it says that $0=-23$. Therefore, it is impossible for $g(x)$ to equal $3$ for any value of $x$. But for any value of $y$ other than $3$, the last equation can be solved to yield $x = \\frac{1-8y}{y-3}$, or, in other words, $g\\left(\\frac{1-8y}{y-3}\\right)=y$.\n\nTherefore, the range of $g(x)$ is $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{3\\} = \\boxed{(-\\infty,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)}$.\n\nSolution #2\n\nWe can rewrite $g(x)$ as follows:\n$$g(x) = \\frac{3x+1}{x+8} = \\frac{3x+24}{x+8}-\\frac{23}{x+8} = 3 - \\frac{23}{x+8}.$$Then we note that $x+8$ takes on all real values, so $\\frac{1}{x+8}$ takes on every value which is the reciprocal of some nonzero real number, i.e., $\\frac{1}{x+8}$ takes on all nonzero values. Accordingly, $3-\\frac{23}{x+8}$ takes on all values not equal to $3$.\n\nTherefore, the range of $g(x)$ is $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{3\\} = \\boxed{(-\\infty,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)}$.",
