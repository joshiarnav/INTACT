This is known as the trial-and-error method.\nStep 3:  Since the equation is of degree 4, we can start by trying out small integer values of $x$.\n\nWe can attempt to solve this equation by trying out a few integer values of $x$ to see if any of them satisfy the equation.\nStep 2:\nWe can start by trying $x = 1$.

Starting with small values, we find that $x = -1$ is a root of this cubic equation. Therefore, the cubic equation can be factored as $(x + 1)(x^2 + 5x + 14).$\n\nNote: I will generate the next step after this one if the current step is not the final step.\nStep 4: \nTo solve the quadratic equation $x^2 + 5x + 14 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = 5$, and $c = 14$. We can calculate the discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$, which is $5^2 - 4(1)(14) = 25 - 56 = -31$. Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic equation has no real roots.\n\nSince the quadratic equation has no real roots, the only integer roots of the original quartic equation are $x = 1$ and $x = -1$.\nStep 5:\nWe can attempt to solve the quadratic equation $x^2 + 5x + 14 = 0$ by factoring. Unfortunately, this quadratic expression does not factor easily, so we can use the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = 5$, and $c = 14$. We can calculate the discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$, which is $5^2 - 4(1)(14) = 25 - 56 = -31$. Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic equation has no real roots, and therefore no integer roots.\nStep 6:\nWe can attempt to solve the quadratic equation $x^2 + 5x + 14 = 0$ by factoring.
