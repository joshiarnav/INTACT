Given that the second term is $ar$, we have $ar=1$, which implies $r=\\frac{1}{a}$.\nStep 2: Substitute $r=\\frac{1}{a}$ into the sum formula and express $S$ in terms of $a$: \\[S=\\frac{a}{1-\\frac{1}{a}}=\\frac{a^2}{a-1}\\]\nStep 3:  To find the smallest possible value of $S$, we need to minimize the expression $\\frac{a^2}{a-1}$.\nThe minimum value of $\\frac{a^2}{a-1}$ can be found by analyzing its behavior as $a$ varies.\nFor $a > 1$, we can use the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of non-negative numbers is greater than or equal to their geometric mean.\nApplying the AM-GM inequality to the expression $\\frac{a^2}{a-1}$, we get \\[\\frac{a^2}{a-1} \\ge \\frac{a-1}{a-1} = 1\\]\nStep 4: \nFrom the inequality obtained, we know that $\\frac{a^2}{a-1} \\ge 1$.

This occurs when $\\frac{a^2}{a-1}$ is equal to 1, and this happens when $a = 2$.\nStep 5: Substituting $a = 2$ into the expression for $S$ gives the smallest possible value of $S$: $S = \\frac{(2)^2}{2-1} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4$.\nSubstitute $a = 2$ into the expression for $S$ to get $S = \\frac{(2)^2}{2-1} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4$.\nTo find the smallest possible value of $S$, we need to minimize the expression $\\frac{4}{a-1}$.\nStep 6: \nTo minimize the expression $\\frac{4}{a-1}$, note that the denominator $a-1$ must be positive.
