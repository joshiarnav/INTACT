    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "For a rational function, when the degree of the numerator is smaller than the degree of the denominator, the denominator grows at a faster rate than the numerator. In this case, the numerator has a degree of 2 while the denominator has a degree of 3. Thus, the function approaches the asymptote $y=\\boxed{0}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Divide both the numerator and the denominator of the given function by x^2.\nStep 2: Simplify the expression to obtain y = \\frac{27+9/x+3/x^2}{27+9/x+3/x^2+1/x}.\nStep 3: Divide both the numerator and the denominator of the expression by 1/x.\nStep 4: Simplify the expression to obtain y = 27/(27+1/x).\nStep 5: \nAs x approaches infinity, 1/x approaches 0, so the expression for y approaches 27/27 = 1.\nSince x approaches infinity, the value of y approaches 1.\nStep 6: The function will have a horizontal asymptote at y = 1.
