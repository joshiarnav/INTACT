    "solution": "Let $P(x) = x^2 + ax + b$ and $Q(x) = x^2 + ax - b.$  We seek $a$ and $b$ so that $Q(P(x))$ has a single real repeated root.\n\nLet the roots of $Q(x)$ be $r_1$ and $r_2.$  Then the roots of $Q(P(x))$ are the roots of the equations $P(x) = r_1$ and $P(x) = r_2.$  Therefore, $Q(x)$ must have a repeated root, which means its discriminant must be 0.  This gives us $a^2 + 4b = 0.$  The repeated root of $Q(x) = x^2 + ax - b$ is then $-\\frac{a}{2}.$\n\nThen, the equation $P(x) = -\\frac{a}{2}$ must also have a repeated root.  Writing out the equation, we get $x^2 + ax + b = -\\frac{a}{2},$ or\n\\[x^2 + ax + \\frac{a}{2} + b = 0.\\]Again, the discriminant must be 0, so $a^2 - 2a - 4b = 0.$  We know $4b = -a^2,$ so\n\\[2a^2 - 2a = 2a(a - 1) = 0.\\]Hence, $a = 0$ or $a = 1.$  If $a = 0,$ then $b = 0.$  If $a = 1,$ then $b = -\\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the solutions $(a,b)$ are $(0,0)$ and $\\left( 1, -\\frac{1}{4} \\right),$ and the final answer is $0 + 0 + 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.$",
