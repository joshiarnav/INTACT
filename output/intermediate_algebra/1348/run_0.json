    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $f(x) = d(x)q(x) +r(x)$. Since $\\deg f = 9$ and $\\deg r = 3$, we must have $\\deg q + \\deg d = 9$.  We know that in division $\\deg r < \\deg d$, which means that $\\deg d \\ge 4$. So\n$$\\deg q \\le 9-4 = \\boxed{5}.$$",
