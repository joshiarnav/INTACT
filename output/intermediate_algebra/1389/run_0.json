    "solution": "We seek to factor $x^4 - 80x - 36.$  Using the Integer Root theorem, we can determine that there are no integer roots, so we look for a factorization into two quadratics.  Assume a factorization of the form\n\\[(x^2 + Ax + B)(x^2 - Ax + C) = x^4 - 80x - 36.\\](We take $A$ as the coefficient of $x$ in the first quadratic; then the coefficient of $x$ in the second quadratic must be $-A,$ to make the coefficent of $x^3$ in their product to be 0.)\n\nExpanding, we get\n\\[(x^2 + Ax + B)(x^2 - Ax + C) = x^4 + (-A^2 + B + C) x^2 + (-AB + AC) x + BC.\\]Matching coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n-A^2 + B + C &= 0, \\\\\n-AB + AC &= -80, \\\\\nBC &= -36.\n\\end{align*}From the second equation, $B - C = \\frac{80}{A}.$  From the first equation, $B + C = A^2.$  Squaring these equations, we get\n\\begin{align*}\nB^2 + 2BC + C^2 &= A^4, \\\\\nB^2 - 2BC + C^2 &= \\frac{6400}{A^2}.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting these, we get\n\\[A^4 - \\frac{6400}{A^2} = 4BC = -144.\\]Then $A^6 - 6400 = -144A^2,$ so $A^6 + 144A^2 - 6400 = 0.$  This factors as $(A^2 - 16)(A^4 + 16A^2 + 400) = 0,$ so $A = \\pm 4.$\n\nTaking $A = 4,$ we get $B - C = 20$ and $B + C = 16,$ so $B = 18$ and $C = -2$.  Thus,\n\\[x^4 - 80x - 36 = (x^2 + 4x + 18)(x^2 - 4x - 2).\\]The quadratic factor $x^4 + 4x + 18$ has no real roots.  The quadratic factor $x^2 - 4x - 2$ has real roots, and their sum is $\\boxed{4}.$",
