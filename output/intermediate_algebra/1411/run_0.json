The polynomial has the form $P(x) = 2x^3-2ax^2+(a^2-81)x-c$ for some positive integers $a$ and $c$. Can you tell me the values of $a$ and $c$?\"\n\nAfter some calculations, Jon says, \"There is more than one such polynomial.\"\n\nSteve says, \"You're right. Here is the value of $a$.\" He writes down a positive integer and asks, \"Can you tell me the value of $c$?\"\n\nJon says, \"There are still two possible values of $c$.\"\n\nFind the sum of the two possible values of $c$.",

    "solution": "Let $r, s, t$ be the three positive integer roots of $P(x).$ Then by Vieta's formulas, \\[\\begin{aligned} r+s+t &= a, \\\\ rs+st+rt &= \\frac{a^2-81}{2}, \\\\ rst &= \\frac{c}{2}. \\end{aligned}\\]Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $a,$ we have \\[rs+st+rt = \\frac{(r+s+t)^2 - 81}{2} = \\frac{(r^2+s^2+t^2) + 2(rs+st+rt) - 81}{2}.\\]This simplifies to \\[r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = 81.\\]Therefore, each of $r, s, t$ lies in the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}.$ Assuming without loss of generality that $r \\le s \\le t,$ we have $81=r^2+s^2+t^2 \\le 3t^2,$ so $t^2 \\ge 27,$ and $t \\ge 6.$ We take cases:\n\nIf $t = 6,$ then $r^2+s^2 = 81 - 6^2 = 45;$ the only solution where $r \\le s \\le 6$ is $(r, s) = (3, 6).$\nIf $t = 7,$ then $r^2+s^2 = 81-7^2 = 32;$ the only solution where $r \\le s \\le 7$ is $(r, s) = (4, 4).$\nIf $t = 8,$ then $r^2+s^2 = 81-8^2 = 17;$ the only solution where $r \\le s \\le 8$ is $(r, s) = (1, 4).$\n\nTherefore, the possible sets of roots of such a polynomial are $(3, 6, 6), (4, 4, 7),$ and $(1, 4, 8).$ Calculating $a = r+s+t$ and $c=2rst$ for each set, we have $(a, c) = (15, 216), (15, 224), (13, 64).$\n\nSince, given the value of $a,$ there are still two possible values of $c,$ it must be that $a = 15,$ since two of the pairs $(a, c)$ have $a = 15,$ but only one has $a = 13.$ Then the sum of the two possible values of $c$ is \\[216 + 224 = \\boxed{440}.\\]",
