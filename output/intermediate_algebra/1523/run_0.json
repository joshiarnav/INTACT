    "solution": "Since $z_1 = 0$, it follows that $c_0 = P(0) = 0$. The nonreal zeros of $P$ must occur in conjugate pairs, so $\\sum_{k=1}^{2004} b_k = 0$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^{2004} a_k = 0$ also. The coefficient $c_{2003}$ is the sum of the zeros of $P$, which is \\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{2004}z_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{2004}a_k + i\\sum_{k=1}^{2004} b_k = 0.\n\\]Finally, since the degree of $P$ is even, at least one of $z_2, \\ldots, z_{2004}$ must be real, so at least one of $b_2, \\ldots, b_{2004}$ is 0 and consequently $b_2 b_3 \\dotsm b_{2004}=0$. Thus the quantities in $\\textbf{(A)}$, $\\textbf{(B)}$, $\\textbf{(C)}$, and $\\textbf{(D)}$ must all be 0.\n\nNote that the polynomial \\[\nP(x) = x(x-2)(x-3)\\cdots(x-2003)\\displaystyle\\left(x + \\sum_{k=2}^{2003} k\\displaystyle\\right)\n\\]satisfies the given conditions, and $\\sum_{k=1}^{2004} c_k = P(1) \\ne 0$.
