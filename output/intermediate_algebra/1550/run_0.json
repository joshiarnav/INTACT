    "solution": "If we consider a negative $a$ and a positive $c$, we can see that this is not true.\nIf we subtract $b$ from both sides we get $a<c$ which we know is true.\nAdding $b$ to both sides again gives us $a<c$ which we know is true.\nAgain, if we consider a negative $a$ and a positive $c$, we see that $c/a$ is negative and hence not greater than $1$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{B, C}$.",
