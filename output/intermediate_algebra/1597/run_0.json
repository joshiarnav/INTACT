    "solution": "Reading from the equation, we see that the center of the ellipse is $(6, 3),$ the length of the semimajor axis is $\\sqrt{25} = 5,$ and the length of the semiminor axis is $\\sqrt{9} = 3.$ Then, the distance from the center to each of the foci must be $\\sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = 4.$\n\nThe major axis is parallel to the $x$-axis, so the coordinates of the two foci are $(6-4,3)=(2,3)$ and $(6+4,3)=(10,3).$ The one with the larger $x$-coordinate is $\\boxed{(10,3)}.$",
