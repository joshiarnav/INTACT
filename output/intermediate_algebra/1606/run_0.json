    "solution": "The given polynomial has degree $4,$ so either it is the product of a linear term and a cubic term, or it is the product of two quadratic terms. Also, we may assume that both terms have leading coefficient $1.$\n\nIn the first case, the linear term must be of the form $x-a,$ so the polynomial must have an integer root $a.$ That is, $a^4-na + 63 = 0$ for some integer $a.$ Since $n > 0,$ this is impossible when $a \\le 0,$ so we must have $a > 0.$ Then \\[n = \\frac{a^4+63}{a} = a^3 + \\frac{63}{a}.\\]Testing various positive divisors of $63,$ we see that $n$ is minimized for $a=3,$ giving $n = 3^3 + \\frac{63}{3} = 27 + 21 = 48.$\n\nIn the second case, let \\[x^4 - nx + 63 = (x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)\\]for some integers $a, b, c, d.$ Comparing the $x^3$ coefficients on both sides shows that $a+c=0,$ so $c=-a.$ Then, comparing the $x^2$ coefficients, we get \\[b + ac + d = 0 \\implies b + d = a^2.\\]We also have $bd = 63,$ looking at the constant terms. The only possibilities for $(b, d)$ are $(b, d) = (1, 63), (7, 9).$ Then the corresponding values of $a$ are $a =\\pm 8, \\pm4,$ giving $n = \\pm 496, \\pm 8.$ Therefore the least value for $n$ is $\\boxed{8}.$",
