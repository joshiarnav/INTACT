    "problem": "Find the sum of the roots, real and non-real, of the equation $x^{2001}+\\left(\\frac 12-x\\right)^{2001}=0$, given that there are no multiple roots.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By the binomial theorem, \\[\\begin{aligned} \\left(\\frac12-x\\right)^{2001}& = (-x)^{2001} + \\binom{2001}{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) (-x)^{2000} + \\binom{2001}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 (-x)^{1999} + \\dotsb \\\\ &= - x^{2001} + \\frac{2001}{2} x^{2000} - \\frac{2001 \\cdot 2000}{8} x^{1999} + \\dotsb. \\end{aligned}\\]Thus, \\[x^{2001} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}-x\\right)^{2001} = \\frac{2001}{2}x^{2000} - \\frac{2001 \\cdot 2000}{8} x^{1999} + \\dotsb.\\](Note that the $x^{2001}$ terms canceled!) Then by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is \\[-\\frac{-2001 \\cdot 2000/8}{2001/2} = \\boxed{500}.\\]\n\nAnother approach is to replace $x$ with $ \\frac{1}{4}-y $, making the equation $ \\left(\\frac{1}{4}-y\\right)^{2001}+\\left(\\frac{1}{4}+y\\right)^{2001}=0 $. Because the left-hand side is symmetric with respect to $y$ and $ -y $, any solution to the equation pairs off with another solution to have a sum of $0$. Since $ x^{2001} $ pairs off with a term of $ -x^{2001} $ from the expansion of the second term in the original equation, this is a degree-$ 2000 $ polynomial equation in disguise, so the sum of its roots is $ 2000\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}-0=500 $.",
