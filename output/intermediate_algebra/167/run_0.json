    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We can write\n\\[j(x) = \\frac{5x + 3}{x} = 5 + \\frac{3}{x}.\\]First, $x$ can take on any non-zero value.  Second, as $x$ takes on all non-zero values, $\\frac{3}{x}$ also takes on all real values except 0, which means $5 + \\frac{3}{x}$ takes on all values except 5.  Therefore, the range of the function is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,5) \\cup (5,\\infty)}.$",

Therefore, we must find the value of x that makes the denominator equal to 0, and exclude that value from the domain.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for x when the denominator is equal to 0\nSet the denominator equal to 0 and solve for x:\n\\[x = 0\\]\n\n## Step 3: Exclude x = 0 from the domain\nSince the denominator is equal to 0 when x = 0, this value must be excluded from the domain.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the range of the function\nSince the function is undefined when x = 0, we can consider the behavior of the function as x approaches 0 from the left and the right.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the limit as x approaches 0 from the left\nLet x approach 0 from the left. Then, x < 0, and the numerator is negative. Therefore, the function approaches negative infinity.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the limit as x approaches 0 from the right\nLet x approach 0 from the right.
