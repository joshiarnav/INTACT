    "solution": "Since the coefficients of $f(x)$ are all real, the nonreal roots come in conjugate pairs.  Without loss of generality, assume that $a_1 + ib_1$ and $a_2 + ib_2$ are conjugates, and that $a_3 + ib_3$ and $a_4 + ib_4$ are conjugates, so $a_1 = a_2,$ $b_1 = -b_2,$ $a_3 = a_4,$ and $b_3 = -b_4.$\n\nThen by Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is\n\\begin{align*}\n(a_1 + ib_1)(a_2 + ib_2)(a_3 + ib_3)(a_4 + ib_4) &= (a_1 + ib_1)(a_1 - ib_1)(a_3 + ib_3)(a_3 - ib_3) \\\\\n&= (a_1^2 + b_1^2)(a_3^2 + b_3^2) \\\\\n&= 65.\n\\end{align*}The only ways to write 65 as the product of two positive integers are $1 \\times 65$ and $5 \\times 13.$  If one of the factors $a_1^2 + b_1^2$ or $a_3^2 + b_3^2$ is equal to 1, then $f(x)$ must have a root of $\\pm i.$  (Remember that none of the roots of $f(x)$ are real.)  We can check that $\\pm i$ cannot be roots, so 65 must split as $5 \\times 13.$\n\nWihtout loss of generality, assume that $a_1^2 + b_1^2 = 5$ and $a_3^2 + b_3^2 = 13.$  Hence, $\\{|a_1|,|b_1|\\} = \\{1,2\\}$ and $\\{|a_3|,|b_3|\\} = \\{2,3\\}$.\n\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is\n\\begin{align*}\n(a_1 + ib_1) + (a_2 + ib_2) + (a_3 + ib_3) + (a_4 + ib_4) &= (a_1 + ib_1) + (a_1 - ib_1) + (a_3 + ib_3) + (a_3 - ib_3) \\\\\n&= 2a_1 + 2a_3 = 6,\n\\end{align*}so $a_1 + a_3 = 3.$  The only possibility is that $a_1 = 1$ and $a_3 = 2.$  Then $\\{b_1,b_2\\} = \\{2,-2\\}$ and $\\{b_3,b_4\\} = \\{3,-3\\},$ so the roots are $1 + 2i,$ $1 - 2i,$ $2 + 3i,$ and $2 - 3i.$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= (x - 1 - 2i)(x - 1 + 2i)(x - 2 - 3i)(x - 2 + 3i) \\\\\n&= [(x - 1)^2 + 4][(x - 2)^2 + 9] \\\\\n&= x^4 - 6x^3 + 26x^2 - 46x + 65.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $p = \\boxed{-46}.$",
