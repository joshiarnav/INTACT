    "solution": "If $(x - 1)^2$ is a factor of $x^3 + bx + c,$ then the other factor must be $x + c,$ to make the leading and constant coefficients match.  Thus,\n\\[(x - 1)^2 (x + c) = x^3 + bx + c.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[x^3 + (c - 2) x^2 + (1 - 2c) x + c = x^3 + bx + c.\\]Matching coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\nc - 2 &= 0, \\\\\n1 - 2c &= b.\n\\end{align*}Then $c = 2,$ so $b = 1 - 2c = -3.$  Thus, $(b,c) = \\boxed{(-3,2)}.$",
