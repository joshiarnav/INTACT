Squaring this equation, we get \\[\\left(\\frac1r+\\frac1s+\\frac1t\\right)^2 = 4,\\]or \\[\\frac1{r^2}+\\frac1{s^2}+\\frac1{t^2}+2\\left(\\frac1{rs}+\\frac1{st}+\\frac1{tr}\\right) = 4.\\]But we also have \\[\\frac1{rs}+\\frac1{st}+\\frac1{tr}=\\frac{r+s+t}{rst}=\\frac{-9}{-1}=9,\\]so \\[\\frac1{r^2}+\\frac1{s^2}+\\frac1{t^2}+2(9) = 4.\\]Therefore, \\[\\frac1{r^2}+\\frac1{s^2}+\\frac1{t^2}=\\boxed{-14}.\\](Note that the left-hand side is a sum of squares, but the right-hand side is negative! This means that some of $r,$ $s,$ and $t$ must be nonreal.)",
