    "problem": "Solve for $x: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Rewrite $3^{2x}$ as $(3^2)^x=9^x$, and subtract $9^x$ from both sides to obtain $19=10^x-9^x$.  There are no solutions of this equation for $x\\leq 0$, because neither $10^x$ nor $9^x$ is greater than 1 if $x\\leq 0$.  Trying $x=1$, $x=2$, and $x=3$, we see that $10^x-9^x$ is increasing for $x>0$, and it equals 19 when $x=\\boxed{2}$.\n\nNote: Using calculus, we could prove that $10^x-9^x$ is monotonically increasing for $x>0$, which would prove that the solution we found is unique.",
