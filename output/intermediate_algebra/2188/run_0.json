This can be expressed as \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^2\\).\nStep 2:  Since the sum of the numbers is equal to the sum of their squares, we can substitute the expression for the sum of squares into the equation to get \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2\\).\nStep 3:  To maximize the arithmetic mean of her numbers, we need to maximize the sum of the numbers given the constraint that the sum of the numbers equals the sum of their squares. The arithmetic mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of elements in the list.\nStep 4:  We can rewrite the given equation as \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 0\\). Rearranging the terms gives us \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i^2 - x_i) = 0\\).\nStep 5: Rewrite the equation in terms of a quadratic expression by letting \\(x = x_i\\), giving \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x^2 - x) = \\frac{n}{2}x^2 - \\frac{n}{2}x = 0\\).\nStep 6: Since we have a quadratic equation, we can factor it or use the quadratic formula to solve for x. Factoring, we get \\(\\frac{n}{2}x(x - 1) = 0\\), which has solutions \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = 1\\).\nStep 7: To maximize the arithmetic mean, we need to distribute the numbers on the list as evenly as possible. Since the list can only contain 0 or 1, the arithmetic mean will be maximized if we use as many 1s as possible.\nStep 8:  Given that the numbers on the list are only 0 or 1, to maximize the arithmetic mean, we should have as many 1s as possible. Therefore, the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean is when all the numbers on the list are 1.\nStep 9: The largest possible value of the arithmetic mean is achieved when all numbers on the list are 1.",
