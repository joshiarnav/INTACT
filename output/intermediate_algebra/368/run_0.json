    "solution": "Since all the $a_i$'s lie between $2$ and $3,$ we try to choose each $A_i$ to be either $2$ or $3.$ Indeed, if any $A_i$ is not 2 or 3, then the corresponding value of $M$ will be at least 1, while using only 2s and 3s guarantees that $M$ will be less than 1.\n\nThe only way to make $19$ with seven numbers, each of which is either $2$ or $3,$ is $19 = 2(2) + 5(3).$ To minimize the largest error, we choose $A_1 = A_2 = 2$ and $A_3 = A_4 = A_5 = A_6 = A_7 = 3,$ since all the $a_i$'s are greater than $2.5$ and are arranged in increasing order. Then the largest of the errors is \\[M = |A_2 - a_2| = |2 - 2.61| = \\boxed{0.61}.\\]",
