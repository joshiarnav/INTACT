    "solution": "Since the coefficients are real, nonreal roots must come in conjugate pairs.  Hence, if there is only one real root that is a root, its multiplicity must be either 2 or 4.\n\nIf the multiplicity of $r$ is 4, then $r$ must be 2 or $-2,$ so the quartic must be either $(x - 2)^4$ or $(x + 2)^4.$  We can check that neither of these fit the given form.\n\nHence, the quartic must be of the form $(x - r)^2 (x^2 + bx + c),$ where $b^2 - 4c < 0.$  Expanding, we get\n\\[x^4 + (b - 2r) x^3 + (r^2 - 2br + c) x^2 + (br^2 - 2cr) x + cr^2 = x^4 + kx^3 + x^2 + 4kx + 16.\\]Matching coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\nb - 2r &= k, \\\\\nr^2 - 2br + c &= 1, \\\\\nbr^2 - 2cr &= 4k, \\\\\ncr^2 &= 16.\n\\end{align*}Then $c = \\frac{16}{r^2}.$  Comparing $b - 2r = k$ and $br^2 - 2cr = 4k,$ we get\n\\[4b - 8r = br^2 - \\frac{32}{r}.\\]Then $4br - 8r^2 = br^3 - 32,$ so $br^3 + 8r^2 - 4br - 32 = 0.$  This equation factors as\n\\[(r - 2)(r + 2)(br + 8) = 0.\\]If $br + 8 = 0,$ then $b = -\\frac{8}{r},$ and\n\\[b^2 - 4c = \\frac{64}{r^2} - 4 \\cdot \\frac{16}{r^2} = 0,\\]so this case is impossible.  Therefore, either $r = 2$ or $r = -2.$\n\nIf $r = 2,$ then $c = 4,$ $b = \\frac{7}{4},$ and $k = -\\frac{9}{4},$ and the quartic becomes\n\\[x^4 - \\frac{9}{4} x^3 + x^2 - 9x + 16 = (x - 2)^2 \\left( x^2 + \\frac{7}{4} x + 4 \\right).\\]If $r = 2,$ then $c = 4,$ $b = -\\frac{7}{4},$ and $k = \\frac{9}{4},$ and the quartic becomes\n\\[x^4 + \\frac{9}{4} x^3 + x^2 + 9x + 16 = (x + 2)^2 \\left( x^2 - \\frac{7}{4} x + 4 \\right).\\]Hence, the possible values of $k$ are $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{4}, -\\frac{9}{4}}.$",
