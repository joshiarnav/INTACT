Setting $j = \\ell+1$ in two of the sums and use the facts that $f(k+1,1) = 1 = f(k,1)$ and $f(1,k+1) = 1 = f(1,k),$ we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\nS(k+2) &= \\left[ f(k,1) + \\sum_{j=2}^k f(k+1-j,j) \\right] + \\left[ \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{k-1} f(k+1-\\ell,\\ell) + f(1,k) \\right] + \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{k-1} f(k-\\ell,\\ell) \\\\\n  &= S(k+1) + S(k+1) + S(k)\n\\end{align*}So $S(k+2) = 2S(k+1) + S(k),$ or $p = 2, q = 1$ so $pq = \\boxed{2}.$",
