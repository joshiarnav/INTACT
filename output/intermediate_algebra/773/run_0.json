    "solution": "From the formula for a geometric series,\n\\[p(x) = 1 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + \\dots + x^{22} = \\frac{x^{24} - 1}{x^2 - 1}.\\]Likewise,\n\\[q(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \\dots + x^{11} = \\frac{x^{12} - 1}{x - 1}.\\]At first, it may look like we can write $p(x)$ as a multiple of $q(x)$:\n\\[\\frac{x^{24} - 1}{x^2 - 1} = \\frac{x^{12} - 1}{x - 1} \\cdot \\frac{x^{12} + 1}{x + 1}.\\]Unfortunately, $\\frac{x^{12} + 1}{x + 1}$ is not a polynomial.  A polynomial of the form $x^n + 1$ is a multiple of $x + 1$ only when $n$ is odd.\n\nSo, we can try to get close by considering $\\frac{x^{11} + 1}{x + 1}.$  Let's also multiply this by $x,$ so that we get a polynomial of degree 12.  Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x^{12} - 1}{x - 1} \\cdot \\frac{x(x^{11} + 1)}{x + 1} &= \\frac{x^{12} - 1}{x - 1} \\cdot \\frac{x^{12} + x}{x + 1} \\\\\n&= \\frac{x^{12} - 1}{x^2 - 1} \\cdot (x^{12} + x) \\\\\n&= (x^{10} + x^8 + x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + 1)(x^{12} + x) \\\\\n&= x^{22} + x^{20} + x^{18} + x^{16} + x^{14} + x^{12} + x^{11} + x^9 + x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x.\n\\end{align*}This is a multiple of $q(x)$ that's very close to $p(x).$  In fact, when we take the difference, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n&p(x) - (x^{22} + x^{20} + x^{18} + x^{16} + x^{14} + x^{12} + x^{11} + x^9 + x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x) \\\\\n&\\quad = -x^{11} + x^{10} - x^9 + x^8 - x^7 + x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1.\n\\end{align*}Now, if we add $q(x),$ we get\n\\begin{align*}\n&p(x) + q(x) - (x^{22} + x^{20} + x^{18} + x^{16} + x^{14} + x^{12} + x^{11} + x^9 + x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x) \\\\\n&\\quad = 2x^{10} + 2x^8 + 2x^6 + 2x^4 + 2x^2 + 2.\n\\end{align*}We can also write this as\n\\begin{align*}\n&p(x) - (x^{22} + x^{20} + x^{18} + x^{16} + x^{14} + x^{12} + x^{11} + x^9 + x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x - q(x)) \\\\\n&\\quad = 2x^{10} + 2x^8 + 2x^6 + 2x^4 + 2x^2 + 2.\n\\end{align*}So, we took $p(x),$ subtracted\n\\[x^{22} + x^{20} + x^{18} + x^{16} + x^{14} + x^{12} + x^{11} + x^9 + x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x - q(x),\\]which we know is a multiple of $q(x),$ and ended up with $\\boxed{2x^{10} + 2x^8 + 2x^6 + 2x^4 + 2x^2 + 2}.$  Since the degree of this polynomial is less than the degree of $q(x),$ this is our remainder.",
