    "solution": "Our equation is\n\\[\\frac{A}{x + 3} + \\frac{6x}{x^2 + 2x - 3} = \\frac{B}{x - 1}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $x^2 + 2x - 3 = (x + 3)(x - 1),$ we get\n\\[A(x - 1) + 6x = B(x + 3).\\]We want to this equation to hold for all values of $x.$  So, we can take $x = -3,$ to get\n\\[A(-4) + 6(-3) = 0.\\]This gives us $A = \\boxed{-\\frac{9}{2}}.$",
