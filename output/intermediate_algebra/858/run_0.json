    "model_solution": "## Step 1: The term in the expansion of a binomial raised to a power that is independent of the variable x is given by the formula $\\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k$, where n is the power to which the binomial is raised, k is the term number (starting from k = 0), and a and b are the two terms in the binomial. In this case, n = 6, and we want to find the term that is independent of x, which means the powers of x in the term $a^{n-k}b^k$ must cancel out. The general term in the expansion is given by $\\binom{6}{k}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}x^2\\right)^{6-k}\\left(-\\frac{1}{3x}\\right)^k$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
