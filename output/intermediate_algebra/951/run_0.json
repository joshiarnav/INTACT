    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the zeros is $-\\frac{b}{a},$ and the sum of the coefficients is $\\frac{c}{a},$ so $b = -c.$  Then the sum of the coefficients is $a + b + c = a,$ which is the coefficient of $x^2.$  Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(A)}}.$\n\nTo see that none of the other choices can work, consider $f(x) = -2x^2 - 4x + 4.$  The sum of the zeros, the product of the zero, and the sum of the coefficients are all $-2.$  The coefficient of $x$ is $-4,$ the $y$-intercept of the graph of $y = f(x)$ is 4, the $x$-intercepts are $-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3},$ and the mean of the $x$-intercepts is $-1,$ so none of the other choices work.",
