    "problem": "A math textbook with a double-digit number of pages is split into sections. Each section is exactly $12$ pages long, with the exception of the epilogue, which is $11$ pages long. Every page belongs to a section. Furthermore, on the bottom of each $5$th page, a trivia fact is presented on the bottom of the page, starting from the fifth page. If a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, then how many pages does the textbook have?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Suppose the book has $p$ pages. It follows that $p \\equiv 11 \\pmod{12}$. Also, since the second-to-last page has a trivia fact, then $p-1$ is divisible by $5$, so $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since $11 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, then $p \\equiv 11 \\pmod{60}$. Now, $p$ is a double-digit number, so it must be either $11$ or $71$. However, the epilogue itself is already $11$ pages long, so it follows that there must be $\\boxed{71}$ pages in the book.",

    "model_solution": "Since we are given that the second-to-last page is a page with a trivia fact, it must be a page that is a multiple of $5$ pages from the beginning of the book.\nLet $n$ be the number of pages in the textbook. Then $n-1$ must be a multiple of $5$ since the second-to-last page is a page with a trivia fact.\nSince $n-1$ is a multiple of $5$, we can write $n-1=5m$ for some nonnegative integer $m$.\nSince there are $12$ pages in each section, with the exception of the epilogue, which has $11$ pages, the total number of pages can be expressed as $12a + 11$ for some nonnegative integer $a$, where $a$ is the number of full sections in the textbook, and this expression is equal to $5m + 1$.\nSince $12a + 11 = 5m + 1$, we have $12a = 5m - 10.$\nWe can rewrite $12a=5m-10$ as $12a+10=5m$, and since $12a+10$ is even, $5m$ must also be even.\nSince $5m$ is even, $m$ must be even.\nSince $m$ is even, we can write $m=2k$ for some nonnegative integer $k$.\nSince $m=2k$ and $12a+10=5m$, we have $12a+10=5(2k)$ which can be rewritten as $12a+10=10k$.\nSince $12a + 10 = 10k$, we have $12a = 10k - 10 = 10(k - 1)$, so $a$ must be even.",
