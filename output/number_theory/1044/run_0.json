    "problem": "The double factorial, denoted by $n!!$, returns the product of all of the odd integers that are less than or equal to $n$. For example, $7!! = 7 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 1$. What is the units digit of $1!! + 3!! + 5!! + 7!! + \\cdots + 49!!$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For any $n$, we note that $n!!$ is the product of a set of odd integers and is thus odd. For $n \\ge 5$, then $n!!$ is divisible by $5$. Thus, the units digit of $n!!$ must be $5$ for $n \\ge 5$. Hence, the units digit of the sum $5!! + 7!! + \\cdots + 49!!$ is units digit of the sum of $5$, $\\frac{49-5}{2} + 1 = 23$ times. The units digit of $23 \\times 5$ is also $5$. Now, we have to sum this with $3!! + 1!! = 3 \\times 1 + 1 = 4$, yielding that the answer is $4+5 = \\boxed{9}$.",
