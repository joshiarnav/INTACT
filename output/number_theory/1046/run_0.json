    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We have $4000=2^5\\cdot5^3$. Any factor of 4000 is in the form $2^a\\cdot5^b$ for $0\\le a\\le5$ and $0\\le b\\le3$. Since $100=2^2\\cdot5^2$, we must count the factors of 4000 that have $a\\ge2$ and $b\\ge2$. That gives $(5-2+1)(3-2+1)=4\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ factors.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Factor 4000 into a product of prime numbers: 4000 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 5 * 5 * 5, or 2^5 * 5^3.\nStep 2:  To count the factors of 4000 that are multiples of 100, we need to count the factors of 4000 that contain 2^2 * 5^2.\nStep 3:  Count the number of factors of 4000 that are multiples of 100, which is given by the product of the number of possible factors for each prime factor needed for the multiple. For 2^2 * 5^2, there are 4 choices for the power of 2 (2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5) and 3 choices for the power of 5 (5^2, 5^3), giving a total of 4 * 3 = 12 factors.\nStep 4:  The total number of positive factors of 4000 that are multiples of 100 is 12.\nStep 5:  We can also determine the number of factors of 4000 that are multiples of 100 by counting the factors of 4000 that do not contain 5^2, since the factors of 4000 that are multiples of 100 must contain 5^2. There are 4 choices for the power of 2 (2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5) and 2 choices for the power of 5 (5^0, 5^1, 5^2, 5^3), but we exclude 5^0 and 5^1, giving 4 * 2 = 8 factors. Since half of the total factors of 4000 (24) are multiples of 100, the number of factors that are multiples of 100 is 24 / 2 = 12.\nStep 4: The total number of positive factors of 4000 that are multiples of 100 is 12.\nStep 4: The total number of positive factors of 4000 that are multiples of 100 is 12.",
