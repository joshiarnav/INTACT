    "solution": "The prime factorization of $2010$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 67$. We must eliminate the factor of $3 \\cdot 67$ in the denominator, so the smallest positive integer that makes $\\frac{n}{2010}$ a terminating decimal is $3 \\cdot 67 = \\boxed{201}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{2010}$ is a terminating decimal, we need to determine the prime factorization of 2010.\nStep 2: The prime factorization of 2010 can be determined as $2010=2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5\\cdot 67$.\nStep 3: For $\\frac{n}{2010}$ to be a terminating decimal, $n$ must be divisible by the prime factors in the denominator, which are 2, 3, and 5, but not by any prime factor other than 2, 3, or 5. This means that $n$ must be divisible by $2^m3^n5^p$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are non-negative integers. The smallest positive integer $n$ will be obtained when $m=1$ (to ensure the presence of a factor of 2), $n=0$ (as there is one 3 in 2010), and $p=0$ (as there is one 5 in 2010).\nStep 4: Calculate the smallest positive integer $n$ by multiplying the factors 2, 3, and 5 together, which gives $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30$.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$",
