    "problem": "What is the sum of the least and the greatest positive four-digit multiples of 4 that can be written each using the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 exactly once?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The number formed by the last two digits of a multiple of 4 is a multiple of 4. 12, 24, and 32 are the only two-digit multiples of 4 that can be formed using each of 1, 2, 3, and 4 at most once. Therefore, the least four-digit multiple of 4 that can be written is 1324 and the greatest is 4312. Their sum is $1324+4312=\\boxed{5636}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  We need to find the sum of the least and greatest positive four-digit multiples of 4 that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 exactly once.\nTo begin, we need to understand the properties of multiples of 4 and how they relate to the arrangement of the given digits.\nA positive integer is a multiple of 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is a multiple of 4.\nStep 2:  For the last two digits to be a multiple of 4, we have two possible combinations: 12 and 24.\nStep 3:  Since we require the number to be a four-digit positive number, the first two digits are not restricted in any way, as long as they are from the set {1,2,3,4}. We can arrange these digits in 4P2 ways, which equals 12.\nStep 4:  We have 12 possible numbers for each combination. To find the least and greatest possible four-digit multiples of 4, we need to arrange the digits 1,2,3, and 4 to form the smallest and largest numbers possible.\nFor the combination 12, the smallest possible number is 1234, and the largest is 4123.\nFor the combination 24, the smallest possible number is 1243, and the largest is 4321.\nThe sum of the least and greatest numbers for the combination 12 is $1234 + 4123 = 5357$.\nThe sum of the least and greatest numbers for the combination 24 is $1243 + 4321 = 5564$.\nStep 5:  The least of these sums is $5357$, and the greatest is $5564$.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10921}$",
