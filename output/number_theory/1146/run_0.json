    "problem": "Alexa has a mixture consisting of 8 ounces of red jelly beans and 13 ounces of green jelly beans. What is the minimum number of ounces of white jelly beans she must buy so that, when added to the old mixture, her new mixture is an integer number of pounds?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since 8+13=21 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, the minimum number of ounces Alexa must add to have an integer number of pounds is $2\\cdot16-21=32-21=\\boxed{11}$.",
