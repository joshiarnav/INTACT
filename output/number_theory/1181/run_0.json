    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "All factors of $2^5\\cdot 3^6$ that are perfect squares must be in the form $(2^m\\cdot 3^n)^2=2^{2m}\\cdot 3^{2n}$, where $0\\le2m\\le5$ and $0\\le2n\\le6$ for integers $m$ and $n$.

We can count the number of even values between $0$ and $6$ (inclusive) to find the possible values for $y$. These are $0$, $2$, $4$, and $6$.\nStep 3:  The number of factors of $2^5\\cdot3^6$ that are perfect squares is the product of the number of possible values for $x$ and the number of possible values for $y$, which is $3\\cdot4$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
