    "problem": "Find the units digit of the sum of the first $21$ positive perfect cubes.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Notice that for each integer $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 19, n \\neq 10$, then using the sum of cubes factorization, $n^3 + (20 - n)^3 = (n + 20 - n)(n^2 + (20-n)n + (20-n)^2)$ $ = 20(n^2 + (20-n)n + (20-n)^2)$. Thus, we can pair each integer with the difference between $20$ and that integer, and the sum of their cubes is divisible by $20$. Hence, the units digit of the sum of the first $19$ cubes, excluding $10$, is equal to $0$. Also, the units digits of $10^3$ and $20^3$ are clearly $0$, so we just need to find the units digit of the cube of $21$, which is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Identify the first few positive perfect cubes and their units digits. The first 6 positive perfect cubes are 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, and 216, and their units digits are 1, 8, 7, 4, 5, and 6, respectively.\nStep 2: Notice that the units digits of the cubes repeat in a cycle of 2: 1, 8; 7, 4; 5, and 6. This pattern will repeat for every group of 5 cubes, and we need to find the units digit of the sum of the first 21 positive perfect cubes. Since 21 is 4 groups of 5, plus 1, we will have a remainder of 1.\nStep 3: Since the first 5 positive perfect cubes have a sum of cubes with units digits 1+8+7+4+5=25, and the next 5 positive perfect cubes have a sum of cubes with units digits 6+3+2+9+4=24, and the next 5 positive perfect cubes have a sum of cubes with units digits 5+6+7+8+9=35, and the next 5 positive perfect cubes have a sum of cubes with units digits 4+5+6+7+8=30, then the units digit of the sum of the first 21 positive perfect cubes is the units digit of a number that is 1 more than a number whose units digit is 5.\nStep 4: Adding 1 to a number whose units digit is 5 results in a units digit of 6.\nStep 5: The units digit of the sum of the first 21 positive perfect cubes is 6.\nStep 6: The units digit of the sum of the first 21 positive perfect cubes is 6.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.",
