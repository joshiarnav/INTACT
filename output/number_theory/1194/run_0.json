    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We observe that for all $n\\geq5$, $n!$ has a units digit of 0, because $5!$ has a factor of 5 and 2, which become a factor of 10. So, the terms in the sum, $5!$, $7!$, $9!$, and $11!$ all have a 0 for the units digit. And, $1!+3! = 1+6 = \\boxed{7}$ is the units digit of the sum.",
