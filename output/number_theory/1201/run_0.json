    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We could do this by the divisibility rules, but that would be quite tedious. It's easier to note that a number divisible by $3, 4,$ and $5$ must be divisible by their product, $3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60$. This is because a number which is divisible by several integers must be divisible by their least common multiple -- however, since $3, 4,$ and $5$ are relatively prime, the least common multiple is just the product of all three. Clearly, there is only one number between $1$ and $100$ divisible by $60;$ that is, $60$ itself. Thus there is only $\\boxed{1}$ such number.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the number of the first one hundred positive integers that are divisible by 3, 4, and 5.\nTo approach this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5.\nThe LCM of these numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by each of them.\nFor 3, 4, and 5, the prime factorization is 3 = 3, 4 = 2^2, and 5 = 5.\nTherefore, the LCM is the product of the highest powers of all the prime factors, which is 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 60.\nStep 2:  To find the number of the first one hundred positive integers that are divisible by 60, we can divide 100 by 60.\nThe quotient gives us the count of numbers divisible by 60 in the first 100 positive integers.\nThis is because 60 divides 100 exactly 1 time with a remainder of 40, meaning 60 is a factor of 100 once.\nStep 3:  $\\frac{100}{60} = 1\\frac{40}{60}$\nStep 4:  $\\frac{100}{60} = 1\\frac{40}{60} = 1\\frac{2}{3}$\nStep 5:  Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we'll consider only whole numbers. Therefore, we'll only count the whole number part of the quotient, which is 1.\nStep 6:  Since we're considering the first one hundred positive integers, we only have to count the whole number part of the quotient, which is 1.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.",
