    "problem": "In any month with a Friday the Thirteenth, what day of the week is the first day of the same month?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If the 13th is a Friday, then the 14th is a Saturday, and the 15th is a Sunday.  Subtracting 14 days (which is two weeks), we find that the first of the month is also a $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the day of the week for the 13th of the month with a Friday the 13th.\nStep 2: Count back 12 days from the 13th to find the first day of the month.\nStep 3: Determine the day of the week the day in step 2 corresponds to.\nStep 4: Since Monday and Tuesday are the only two days that, when you count back 12 days, will result in a Friday the Thirteenth, the first day of any month with a Friday the Thirteenth must be either a Monday or a Tuesday.\nStep 5: Determine which day of the week corresponds to the first day of the month by counting back the number of days that must be subtracted to reach the first of the month from the 13th, which will be 5 days when the 13th is on a Friday.\nStep 6: Since there are 5 days between the first and the 13th of the month, count back 5 days from Friday to determine the day of the week for the first day of the month.\nStep 6: Count back 5 days from Friday to determine the day of the week for the first day of the month.\nStep 5: The first day of any month with a Friday the 13th must be a Monday because it is the only day that, when you count back 12 days, will result in a Friday the Thirteenth.\nStep 6: Count back 5 days from Friday: Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday, Monday, Sunday.\nThe first day of any month with a Friday the 13th must be a Monday.",
