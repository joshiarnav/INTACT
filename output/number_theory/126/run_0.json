    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 3) \\cdot x(x + 3)}{40} = \\frac{x(x + 3)^2}{40}.\\] To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nThis expression is not an integer for $x =$ 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when $x = 5$, this expression is $5 \\cdot 8^2/40 = 8$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 8 and 40 is 8, and $x + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8$.  The least common multiple is 40, and $x(x + 3) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 3) = 40$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{8}$.",

Mathematically, this can be expressed as $GCD(a,b) \\cdot LCM(a,b) = ab$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, in our case, we have $$(x + 3) \\cdot x(x + 3) = 40 \\cdot b,$$ where $b$ is the unknown integer we need to find.\nStep 6:  This equation allows us to express the relationship between the two integers and their GCD and LCM.\nTo find the unknown integer b, we divide both sides of the equation by $(x+3)$ to get $x(x+3) = 40b/(x+3)$.\nSince $x$ must be a divisor of $40$, we can try different divisors of $40$ to see which one leads to a valid solution for $b$.\nStep 2: \nWe know that x must be a divisor of 40, so we can try each divisor of 40 and see which one leads to a valid solution for b.\nTherefore, we try each divisor of 40, which are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40, to see if any of them satisfy the equation $x(x+3) = 40b/(x+3)$.\nWe try each divisor of 40, which are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40, to see if any of them satisfy the equation $x(x+3) = 40b/(x+3)$ and find that $x = 1$ and $x = 5$ are the two possible solutions.\nStep 3:\n$x = 1$ and $x = 5$ are the two possible solutions. We need to check if both of them are valid and find the smallest value of $b$ in each case.\nWe check each possible value of $x$ to see which one leads to a valid solution for $b$.\nWe need to check each possible value of $x$ to see which one leads to a valid solution for $b$.

This gives us one possible value for the unknown integer $b$. Next, we check the case when $x = 5$. Substituting $x = 5$ into the equation $x(x+3) = 40b/(x+3)$, we get $5(5+3) = 40b/(5+3) \\Rightarrow 40 = \\frac{40}{8}b \\Rightarrow b = 40$.
