    "problem": "What is the greatest common divisor of all of the members of the set containing all numbers that are the product of four consecutive positive integers?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "These numbers are all in the form $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)\\pmod 4$, there will be one number of each residue, so one of the numbers will be divisible by 2 and another divisible by 4, leaving the product divisible by 8. Similarly, one of the numbers will be $0\\mod 3$, so the product will be divisible by 3. The GCD must therefore be divisible by $3\\cdot8=24$. It also must be less than or equal to the smallest number in the set, $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=24$, so it must be $\\boxed{24}$ exactly.",

Since every member of the set is the product of four consecutive positive integers, 12 - 6n - 6n^2 + n^3 must be a multiple of the greatest common divisor of the set. Hence, the greatest common divisor of the set must divide 12 - 6n - 6n^2 + n^3 for all integer values of n.\nStep 8: Since 12 - 6n - 6n^2 + n^3 must be a multiple of the greatest common divisor of the set for all integer values of n, and 1 is a factor of every integer, 12 - 6n - 6n^2 + n^3 must be a multiple of 1 for all values of n, but it must also be a multiple of the greatest common divisor of the set. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of the set must be 1.\nStep 9: Since any integer is part of the set, we can substitute n = 1, n = 2, n = 3, etc. to find that none of these products share a common divisor greater than 1.\nStep 10: The product of four consecutive positive integers is either even or divisible by 3.",
