    "solution": "For $n\\ge5$, $n!$ includes the product $2\\times5=10$, which means the units digit of $n!$ is 0 (since 0 multiplied by any number is 0). Therefore, it only remains to find the units digit of $1!+2!+3!+4!$, which is the units digit of $1+2+6+4=13$. Thus, the units digit of $1!+2!+\\ldots+50!$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
