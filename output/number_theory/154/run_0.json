    "problem": "What is the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{123}{999}$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We can write $\\frac{123}{999}$ as $0.\\overline{123}$. To see why, let $x=0.\\overline{123}$, and subtract $x$ from $1000x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&1000x &=& 123&.123123123\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.123123123\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&999x &=& 123 &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{123} = \\frac{123}{999}$.\n\nThis decimal repeats every 3 digits. Since $123{,}999$ is divisible by $3$ (as the sum of the digits of $123{,}999$ is equal to $33$), it follows that $123{,}999^{\\rm th}$ digit after the decimal point is the same as the third digit after the decimal point, namely $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Convert the given fraction to a decimal.\nStep 2: Because 123 and 999 are both divisible by 3, the decimal expansion of $\\frac{123}{999}$ will terminate and will have a repeating block of digits.\nStep 2: Simplify the fraction to $\\frac{41}{333}$ by dividing numerator and denominator by 3.\nStep 3: The fraction $\\frac{41}{333}$ cannot be simplified any further because 41 and 333 share no common factors other than 1.\nStep 4: Perform long division to calculate the decimal expansion of $\\frac{41}{333}$, which is $0.123\\overline{12}$, with the block $12$ repeating indefinitely.\nStep 5: The next digit after 123,999 is the 124,000th digit after the decimal point. Since the repeating block of digits is $12$, we can find the 124,000th digit after the decimal point by finding the remainder when 124,000 is divided by 2, because the block $12$ has a length of 2.\nStep 6: 124,000 divided by 2 is 62,000. Since 62,000 is even, the 124,000th digit will be the same as the 2nd digit in the repeating block, which is 2.\nStep 7: Since the repeating block is 2 digits long, we can find the 123,999th digit following the same logic as in the previous step. The remainder when 123,999 is divided by 2 is 1.\nStep 8: Since the remainder when 123,999 is divided by 2 is 1, the 123,999th digit is the same as the 1st digit in the repeating block.\nStep 9: Since the remainder when 123,999 is divided by 2 is 1, the 123,999th digit is the same as the 1st digit in the repeating block, which is 1.",
