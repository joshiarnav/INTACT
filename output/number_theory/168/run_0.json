    "problem": "A Penteria is a special (fictional) kind of bacteria such that, regardless of the original population in a collection, the population increases by $5$ every minute. Additionally, at the end of every hour, all but the initial ones die. If $137$ Penteria are alive after $506$ minutes, how many were there at the beginning?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We have that $506\\equiv 26\\pmod {60}$, so $26$ minutes have passed in the latest hour. Let $a$ be the initial population. Then $a+26\\cdot 5=137\\implies a=137-26\\cdot 5=137-130=\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let $x$ represent the number of Penteria at the beginning.\nSince the population increases by $5$ every minute but is reset every hour, we can express the number of Penteria as $x+5m$ after $m$ minutes, where $m$ is an integer between $0$ and $59$ inclusive. Thus, after $506$ minutes, the number of Penteria is $x+5(506)=x+2530$.\n\\text{The number of Penteria after 506 minutes is 137}, $x+2530=137$.\nSubtracting $2530$ from both sides of the equation gives $x=-2393$.\nDividing both sides of the equation by -1 gives $-x=2393$.\n## Step 1: $x=-2393$.\nDividing both sides of the equation by -1 gives $-x=2393$ is incorrect because the correct step is to divide both sides of the equation $x=-2393$ by -1 to solve for $x$.
