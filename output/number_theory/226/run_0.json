    "model_solution": "Step 1: We must first find the decimal expansion of $\\dfrac{1}{37}$.\nStep 2: The decimal expansion of $\\dfrac{1}{37}$ is $0.\\overline{027}$, which has a three-digit repeating block.\nStep 3: Since the repeating block has 3 digits, we divide $291$ by $3$, which gives us a quotient of $97$ and a remainder of $0$. This means that the $291^{\\text{st}}$ digit is the last digit of the 97th repetition of the repeating block.\nStep 4: Since the remainder is 0, we know that the 291st digit is the last digit of the 97th repetition of the repeating block, which is the 3rd digit of the repeating block. Therefore, the 291st digit is 7.\nStep 5: Therefore, the $291^{\\text{st}}$ digit past the decimal point in the expansion of $\\dfrac{1}{37}$ is 7.\nStep 6: Since the repeating block is 027 and the 3rd digit of the block is 7, the 291st digit is 7.\nSince the remainder is 0, we know that the 291st digit is the last digit of the 97th repetition of the repeating block, which is the 3rd digit of the repeating block.\nStep 7: Therefore the $291^{\\text{st}}$ digit past the decimal point in the expansion of $\\dfrac{1}{37}$ is 7.\nStep 6: The repeating block is 027 and the 3rd digit of the block is 7, the 291st digit is 7.\nStep 7:\nTherefore the $291^{\\text{st}}$ digit past the decimal point in the expansion of $\\dfrac{1}{37}$ is 7.",
