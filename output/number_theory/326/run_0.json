    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let the integers be $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$.  Their product is $n^3-n$.  Thus $n^3=720+n$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than $720$ is $729=9^3$, and indeed $729=720+9$.  So $n=9$ and the largest of the integers is $n+1=\\boxed{10}$.",

Then $x+1$ and $x+2$ represent the next two integers. \n\nThe equation $x(x+1)(x+2)=720$ is equivalent to $x(x+1)(x+2)-720=0$.\n$(x-8)(x^{2}+11x+90)=(x-8)(x+10)(x+9)=0$\n$x-8=0 \\text{ or }x+10=0 \\text{ or }x+9=0$\n$x = 8$ or $x = -10$ or $x = -9$\nSince the integers are consecutive, $x$ must be positive, so $x=8$ is the only valid solution.\nSince $x$ represents the first of the three consecutive integers, the integers are 8, 9, and 10.\nFinal Answer.",
