    "problem": "The number 64 is both a perfect cube and a perfect square, since $4^3 = 64$ and $8^2 = 64$. What is the next larger number that is both a perfect cube and a perfect square?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since 2 and 3 are relatively prime, a number is both a perfect square and a perfect cube if and only if it is a perfect sixth power. $2^6=64$ and the next such number is $3^6=\\boxed{729}$.",
