    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then $n = 7k+3$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $2n+1 = 2(7k+3)+1 = 14k+6+1 = 14k+7 = 7(2k+1)$. Since $7(2k+1)$ is divisible by 7, the remainder when $2n+1$ is divided by 7 is $\\boxed{0}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  We are given that n gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, so we can express n as n = 7k + 3, where k is an integer.\nStep 2:  We can then express 2n + 1 in terms of k by substituting the expression for n into the equation 2n + 1, resulting in 2(7k + 3) + 1 = 14k + 6 + 1 = 14k + 7.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to determine the remainder when 14k + 7 is divided by 7.\nStep 4:  We observe that 14k is divisible by 7, so it leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 7.\nStep 5:  Therefore, when 14k + 7 is divided by 7, it will leave the same remainder as 7 divided by 7, which is 0, plus the remainder of 7 divided by 7, which is 0, plus the remainder of 1 divided by 7, which is 1.\nStep 6: The remainder is therefore 1.\nStep 7:  $14k + 7 = 7(2k + 1) + 0$, so the remainder is 0.\nThe remainder is $0$.\nThe remainder is 0.\nStep 8: The remainder is $0$.",
