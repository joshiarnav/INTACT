    "problem": "Let's call a prime number a $\\textit{reversible prime}$ if the number formed by reversing its digits is also prime. What is the smallest reversible prime greater than 17?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "To find the smallest reversible prime greater than 17, we first consider the two-digit primes greater than 17. 19 is prime, but $91=7\\times13$ is not.\n\nWe skip all of the two-digit primes whose tens digit is 2 since the number formed by reversing the digits will be even and hence not prime.\n\nNext try the prime 31, and since 13 is prime as well, the smallest reversible prime greater than 17 is $\\boxed{31}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Start by listing all prime numbers greater than 17 and check if their reverse is also prime.\nStep 2:  Begin checking prime numbers greater than 17 to see if their reverse is also prime.\nStep 2:  Check if 19 and its reverse 91 are prime numbers. Since 91 is not a prime number, we move on to the next prime number.\nStep 3:  Check if 23 and its reverse 32 are prime numbers. Since 32 is not a prime number, we continue our search for a reversible prime.\nStep 4:  Check if 29 and its reverse 92 are prime numbers. Since 92 is not a prime number, we move on to the next prime number.\nStep 5:  Check if 31 and its reverse 13 are prime numbers. Since both 31 and 13 are prime numbers, 31 is a reversible prime.\nStep 6:  The prime number 37 and its reverse 73 are both prime numbers, so 37 is also a reversible prime.\nStep 7:  Check if 41 and its reverse 14 are prime numbers. Since 14 is not a prime number, we move on to the next prime number.\nStep 8:  Check if 43 and its reverse 34 are prime numbers. Since 34 is not a prime number, we move on to the next prime number.\nStep 9:  Check if 47 and its reverse 74 are prime numbers. Since 74 is not a prime number, we move on to the next prime number.",
