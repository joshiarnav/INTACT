    "solution": "We want to find the residue $c$ such that $35c \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$. Recall that, since 35 is relatively prime to 47, this inverse exists and is unique. To make use of the table we are given, we notice that $35 = 5\\cdot 7$. We can multiply both sides of $35c \\equiv 1\\pmod{47}$ by the inverse of 5 to obtain  \\begin{align*}\n19\\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 19\\cdot 1 \\pmod{47} \\implies \\\\\n(19\\cdot 5) \\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{47} \\implies \\\\\n1 \\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{47}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}Now we can multiply both sides by 27, the inverse of 7, to find  \\begin{align*}\n27\\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 27\\cdot 19 \\pmod{47} \\implies \\\\\nc &\\equiv 513 \\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting 470 from 513 does not change its residue (mod 47), so we have $c\\equiv 43\\pmod{47}$. Since $0\\leq 43 < 47$, $\\boxed{43}$ is the desired residue.\n\nRemark: More generally, the approach above shows that $(ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}$, where $b^{-1}$ denotes the modular inverse of $b$.",
