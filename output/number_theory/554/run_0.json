    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We must find the least prime number, $p$, such that $p=25n+2$ for some positive integer $n$. It is clear that $n$ must be odd because otherwise $p$ is divisible by 2 and hence not prime. $n=1$ gives $p=27$, which is composite. $n=3$ gives $p=77$, which is composite. But $n=5$ gives $p=127$, which is prime. Thus, $\\boxed{127}$ is the least prime number greater than 25 that has a remainder of 2 when divided by 25.",

Since we are looking for a number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 25, add 2 to each of these multiples to find potential candidates. The first few candidates are 27, 52, and 77.\nStep 3:  Among the candidates 27, 52, and 77, identify the prime numbers to find the least prime number greater than 25 that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 25.\nStep 4:  From the candidates 27, 52, and 77, identify the prime numbers. 27 is not a prime number (it is 3^3), 52 is not a prime number (it is 2 * 2 * 13), and 77 is not a prime number (it is 7 * 11).\nStep 5: \n77 is not a prime number, so check the next multiple of 25, which is 100. The next potential candidate is 100 + 2 = 102. Among the candidates 27, 52, 77, and 102, identify the prime numbers.\nStep 6: \nAmong the candidates 27, 52, 77, and 102, identify the prime numbers. 102 is not a prime number (it is 2 * 3 * 17).\nStep 7:  The next multiple of 25 is 125, so the next potential candidate is 125 + 2 = 127. Check if 127 is a prime number.\nStep 8: \n127 is a prime number.\nStep 9: \nThe least prime number greater than 25 that will have a remainder of 2 when divided by 25 is 127.\nStep 10: The next multiple of 25 is 125, so the next potential candidate is 125 + 2 = 127.
