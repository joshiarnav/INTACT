    "solution": "We can line up the numbers and subtract just as we do in base 10.  For example, when we borrow from the $9^1$s place, the digit 1 in the units place becomes $10$, while the digit in the $9^1$s place decreases by 1. Continuing in this way, we find  $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c} & & \\cancelto{7}{8} & \\cancelto{10}{1}_9 \\\\ &- & 7 & 2_9 \\\\ \\cline{2-4} & & & 8_9, \\end{array} $$so the difference is $\\boxed{8_9}$.",

We need 3 nines to get to -24, so 3 * 9 = 27. Then -24 = -27 + 3. The negative sign is equivalent to 8 (the largest negative number in base 9), so we write -24 as 8 - 3 = 5.\nThe final answer is: $18_9.$",
