    "problem": "A book with 50 pages numbered 1 through 50 has its pages renumbered in reverse, from 50 to 1. For how many pages do both sets of page numbers share the same ones digit?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For any given page, the sum of the original page number and the new page number is 51, an odd number. Therefore, no page is such that both sets of page numbers share the same ones digit and the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.",

Count the numbers in the list of matching ones digits.\nStep 4:  There are 10 numbers in the list of matching ones digits, and for each of these numbers, there are 10 corresponding page numbers in the list.\nStep 5:  Count the total number of pages that share the same ones digit in both sets of page numbers.\nStep 6:  $10 \\times 10 = 100$\nStep 7:  However, the step 4 counted pages such as 11 and 22 twice, so subtract 20 to get the final answer.",
