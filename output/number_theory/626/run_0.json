To find the smallest $n$, we need to find the smallest possible value of $n$ by determining the remainder $r$.\n\nNote: I will provide the next steps if needed.\nStep 3:  We are looking for the smallest positive integer $n$ that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, and a remainder of 4 when divided by 5. We can start by listing numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 and 4, and then check which of these numbers also leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5.\nStep 4:  We can start by listing numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 and 4. The numbers that satisfy this condition are of the form $3a+1$ and $4b+1$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. To find the numbers that also leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, we need to check which of these numbers can be expressed in the form $5c+4$, where $c$ is an integer.\nStep 5:  We can systematically check the numbers that satisfy the first two conditions. The numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by both 3 and 4 are in the form $12c + 1$ for some integer $c$.\nStep 6:  We need to check which numbers in the form $12c+1$ leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 5. To do this, we can substitute values of $c$ into the expression $12c+1$ and check whether the resulting numbers are of the form $5d+4$ for some integer $d$.\nStep 7:  We will start checking the values of $12c+1$ for $c = 0, 1, 2, ...$ until we find the first value that leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5.\nStep 8:  Let's start checking the values of $12c+1$ for $c = 0, 1, 2, ...$.
