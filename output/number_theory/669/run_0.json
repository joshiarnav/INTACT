    "problem": "If the first day of a month is Monday, what day of the week is the twenty-third day?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The days of the week repeat every $7$ days. So days $1, 1+7, 1+14, \\ldots$ are all on Mondays. Since day $22=1+21$ is a Monday, the twenty-third day is a $\\boxed{\\text{Tuesday}}$. In other words, if the remainder when $n$ is divided by $7$ is $1$, the $n$th day is a Monday. The remainder when $23$ is divided by $7$ is $2$, so the day is one day after Monday. That's Tuesday.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine how many days are in the period from the first day to the twenty-third day of the month, which is 22 days.\nStep 2: Determine how many weeks are in 22 days by dividing 22 by 7.\nStep 3: Calculate the remainder of 22 divided by 7 to determine the number of additional days beyond the complete weeks.\nStep 4: Since 22 \u00f7 7 = 3 with a remainder of 1, there are 3 complete weeks and 1 additional day.\nStep 5: Since there are 3 complete weeks, the twenty-third day will have the same day of the week as the first day. Adding the 1 additional day brings it to Tuesday.\nSince there are 3 complete weeks, the twenty-third day will have the same day of the week as the first day. Adding the 1 additional day brings it to Tuesday.\nStep 6: The twenty-third day of the month is a Tuesday. Final Answer",
