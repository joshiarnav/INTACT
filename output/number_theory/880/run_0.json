    "problem": "On a Tuesday, a magician said, ``I made my wife disappear 31 days ago.'' What day of the week did he make her disappear?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since $31 \\equiv 3$ (mod 7), he made his wife disappear 3 days before a Tuesday, or $\\boxed{\\mbox{Saturday}}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: List the days of the week, starting from today: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.\nStep 2: Make a table with columns for day of the week, remainder of days past since the beginning of the year, and remainder of days since the last Tuesday (the beginning of the year).\nStep 3: Starting with today (Tuesday), list the day of the week for each possible number of days ago: 0 days ago (Tuesday), 1 day ago (Monday), 2 days ago (Sunday), 3 days ago (Saturday), 4 days ago (Friday), 5 days ago (Thursday), 6 days ago (Wednesday), 7 days ago (Tuesday), 8 days ago (Monday), 9 days ago (Sunday), 10 days ago (Saturday), 11 days ago (Friday), 12 days ago (Thursday), 13 days ago (Wednesday), 14 days ago (Tuesday), 15 days ago (Monday), 16 days ago (Sunday), 17 days ago (Saturday), 18 days ago (Friday), 19 days ago (Thursday), 20 days ago (Wednesday), 21 days ago (Tuesday), 22 days ago (Monday), 23 days ago (Sunday), 24 days ago (Saturday), 25 days ago (Friday), 26 days ago (Thursday), 27 days ago (Wednesday), 28 days ago (Tuesday), 29 days ago (Monday), 30 days ago (Sunday), 31 days ago (Saturday).\nStep 4: Identify the day of the week that corresponds to 31 days ago in the table.\nNext step: Count the number of days from the beginning of the year to Tuesday. Since the problem states that it has been 31 days since the magician made his wife disappear, count backwards from Tuesday to determine which day of the week it was 31 days ago.\nStep 5: Since the year starts on a different day of the week, count the remainder of days past since the last Tuesday (the beginning of the year). There are 7 days in a week, so divide 31 by 7 and find the remainder. 31 divided by 7 is 4 with a remainder of 3. Therefore, 31 days ago would be 3 days before the last Tuesday.\nStep 6: Subtract 3 days from Tuesday: Monday, Sunday, Saturday.\nStep 7: Since there are 7 days in a week, the remainder of 3 represents 3 days before Tuesday, which would be Saturday.\nStep 6: Subtract 3 days from Tuesday: Monday, Sunday, Saturday.",
