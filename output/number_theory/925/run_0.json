    "solution": "Let a common solution be $a$. Then we know \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 3 & \\pmod 4\\\\\na\\equiv 1 & \\pmod 3\\\\\na\\equiv 1 & \\pmod 5\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,5)=1$, $(2)$ and $(3)$ together yield $a\\equiv 1\\pmod {3\\cdot 5}$ which is the same as $a\\equiv 1\\pmod {15}$. Then there exists an integer $n$ such that $a=1+15n$. Substituting this into $(1)$ gives \\[1+15n\\equiv 3\\pmod 4\\implies n\\equiv 2\\pmod 4\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $2$. Then $n\\ge 2\\implies a=1+15n\\ge 31$. $31$ satisfies the original congruences so subtracting it from both sides of each gives \\begin{align*}\na-31\\equiv -28\\equiv 0 & \\pmod 4\\nonumber\\\\\na-31\\equiv -30\\equiv 0 & \\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-31\\equiv -30\\equiv 0 & \\pmod 5\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $a-31\\equiv 0\\pmod {3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5}$, that is, $a\\equiv 31\\pmod{60}$.\n\nNote that any solution of the above congruence also satisfies the original ones. Then the two solutions are $31$ and $60+31=91$. Thus, $31+91=\\boxed{122}$.",
