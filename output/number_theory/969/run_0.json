    "problem": "The number of toy cars that Ray has is a multiple of $6$. When he loses two of them, the number of cars that he has left is a multiple of $n$. If $n$ is a positive even integer less than $10$, then how many possible values are there for $n$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $n=2m$. Let $b$ be the number of cars that Ray originally had. Clearly $b=6a$ for some positive integer $a$. Additionally, \\begin{align*} b-2\\equiv 0\\pmod n&\\implies 6a\\equiv 2\\pmod {2m} \\\\ &\\implies 3a\\equiv 1\\pmod m.\\end{align*} Such $a$ exists if and only if $3$ is invertible modulo $m$. In other words, $\\gcd(3,m)=1$. We have that $n<10\\implies m=\\frac{n}{2}<5$. The only $0<m<5$ relatively prime to $3$ are $1,2,4$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{3}$ possible values of $n$: $2$, $4$, and $8$.",

If he loses two cars and the number of cars left is a multiple of $n$, then the number of cars he has left is $(6k-2)$ for some nonnegative integer $k$, and it is a multiple of $n$ for some even $n$ less than $10$.\nStep 3:\nSince $6k-2$ is even, the only possibilities for $n$ are $2, 4,$ and $6$.\nStep 4: We know that $6k-2$ is a multiple of $2$ since it is even, and it is a multiple of $3$ if $k$ is a multiple of $3$. We already know that $6k-2$ is a multiple of $2$, so it is a multiple of $6$ if and only if it is a multiple of $3$.

If $k$ is a multiple of $3$, then $6k-2$ is a multiple of $6$, so $n$ can be $2$, $4$, or $6$.\nStep 6:\nLet's count the number of possible values for $n$: $2$ and $4$ when $k$ is not a multiple of $3$, and $2$, $4$, or $6$ when $k$ is a multiple of $3$. There are $3$ values of $k$ that are not multiples of $3$ for each $k$, and there are $3$ values of $k$ that are multiples of $3$ for each $k$.\nStep 7:\nIf we let $k=0, 1, 2$ we have $6k-2=2, 4, 8$ which are multiples of $2$ but not $6$. If we let $k=3, 4, 5$ we have $6k-2=14, 22, 32$ which are multiples of $6$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.",
