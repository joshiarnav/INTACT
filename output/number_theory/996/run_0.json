Since one number has a units digit of 2, we need to find the product of this number with 2 in base 4: 2 * 2 = 4, 2 * 3 = 12, 2 * 1 = 2, 2 * 0 = 0. The only non-zero product is 12, which has a units digit of 2.\nStep 4: Since all non-zero products have a units digit of 2, any two numbers with a units digit of 2 in base 4 will have a product with a units digit of 2.\nStep 5: Therefore, the units digit of the product of two numbers with units digit 2 in base 4 is 2.\nStep 6: The units digit of the product of two numbers with units digit 2 in base 4 is 2.\nStep 6: The units digit of the product of two numbers with units digit 2 in base 4 is 2.",
