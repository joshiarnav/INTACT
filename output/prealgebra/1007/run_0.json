    "problem": "A housefly sits on the outer edge of a rotating circular ceiling fan with a diameter of 6 feet. The fan rotates constantly at a rate of 20 revolutions per minute. How many minutes had the housefly been on the fan during the time it took to travel $19{,}404\\pi$ feet? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "A ceiling fan with a diameter of 6 feet has a circumference of $6\\pi$ feet. If the fly traveled $19{,}404\\pi$ feet, then it must have made $19{,}404\\pi \\div 6\\pi = 3234$ revolutions. Since the fan rotates 20 times per minute, that's $3234 \\div 20 = 161.7$ minutes, or about $\\boxed{162\\text{ minutes}}$, to the nearest whole number.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: First, we need to find the circumference of the circular ceiling fan.\nThe circumference of a circle is given by $C=2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the fan is 6 feet, the radius is half of that, which is 3 feet.\n\nSo, the circumference of the circular ceiling fan is $C=2\\pi(3)=6\\pi$ feet.\nStep 2: \n$6\\pi \\cdot m = 19404\\pi \\Rightarrow m = \\frac{19404\\pi}{6\\pi}$\nStep 3: $m = \\frac{19404\\pi}{6\\pi} = 3240$\nSince the fan rotates at a rate of 20 revolutions per minute, the time it takes to travel $19{,}404\\pi$ feet is the number of revolutions it takes to cover that distance divided by the fan's rate of rotation.
