Therefore, the total number of whole numbers with exactly one 0 is 9 x 9 x 9 = 729.\n## Step 4: Consider the restriction when the hundreds place digit is 1\nWhen the hundreds place digit is 1, the tens and ones place can be any digit from 0 to 9, excluding 1, to ensure there is only one 0 in the number. Therefore, there are 8 choices for the tens place and 9 choices for the ones place when the hundreds place is 1. However, this step was already accounted for in the calculation of the total number of whole numbers with exactly one 0 in Step 3.\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of whole numbers with exactly one 0\nFor each of the 8 choices for the hundreds place being 1, there are 8 choices for the tens place (excluding 1) and 9 choices for the ones place (excluding 1). Therefore, the total number of whole numbers with exactly one 0 when the hundreds place is 1 is 8 x 8 x 9 = 576.\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of whole numbers with exactly one 0\nFor 8 choices for the hundreds place being 1 to 9, there are different numbers of choices for the tens and ones place, but all were considered in the initial count of 729 whole numbers with exactly one 0, so no further calculation is necessary.\n## Step 6: Subtract the incorrect count for numbers starting with 1 from the total count\n729 - 576 = 153\n## Step 7: Since we already calculated the correct total number of whole numbers with exactly one 0 in Step 3, no further calculation is required. The correct solution is Step 3.\n## Step 4\nFor each of the 8 choices for the hundreds place being 1, there are 8 choices for the tens place (excluding 1) and 9 choices for the ones place (excluding 1). Therefore, the total number of whole numbers with exactly one 0 when the hundreds place is 1 is 8 x 8 x 9 = 576.\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of combinations for the hundreds place being 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\nThe total number of combinations is 9 x 9 x 9 = 729.",
