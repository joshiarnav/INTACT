    "problem": "What is the largest possible area, in square centimeters, of a right triangle with one side of length 12 cm and another side of length 20 cm?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Either both given sides are legs, or the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse.  If both sides are legs, then the area of the triangle is $(12)(20)/2 = 120$ square centimeters.\n\nIf the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse, then the ratio of the given leg length to the hypotenuse is $12/20=3/5$, so the triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle and the other leg has length 16 cm.  The triangle then has area $(12)(16)/2 = 96$ square centimeters.\n\nThe largest possible area then is $\\boxed{120}$ square centimeters.",

This is an optimization problem that involves a geometric figure, a right triangle, and we will use the formula for the area of a triangle.\nStep 2: The area \\(A\\) of a right triangle is given by the formula \\(A=\\frac{1}{2}bh\\), where \\(b\\) is the length of the base and \\(h\\) is the height.\nStep 3: Since the largest area will be obtained when the base and height are as large as possible, we can choose one of the given sides as the base and the other side as the height.\nStep 4: Let's choose the side of length 12 cm as the base and the side of length 20 cm as the height.\nStep 5: The area \\(A\\) of the triangle is given by the formula \\(A=\\frac{1}{2}(12)(20)=120\\) square centimeters.\nStep 6: We have found the largest possible area of a right triangle with one side of length 12 cm and another side of length 20 cm.\nLet's choose the side of length 20 cm as the base and the side of length 12 cm as the height.\nStep 7: The area \\(A\\) of the triangle is given by the formula \\(A = \\frac{1}{2}(20)(12) = 120\\) square centimeters.\nNeither of the two choices we made for the base and height will give us the largest area.\nStep 8: Alternatively, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the third side of the triangle, and then use this length as the base or height in the area formula.",
