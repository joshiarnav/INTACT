    "problem": "Bekah has four brass house number digits: 2, 3, 5 and 7, and only has one of each number. How many distinct numbers can she form using one or more of the digits?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We have four cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: When there is only one digit, we have 4 choices.\n\nCase 2: When there are two digits, we have 4 choices for the first digit and 3 choices for the second digit. So a total of $4\\times3=12$ choices.\n\nCase 3: When there are three digits, we have 4 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second digit, and 2 choices for the third digit, so a total of $4\\times3\\times2=24$ choices.\n\nCase 4: When there are four digits, we have 4 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second digit, 2 choices for the third digit, and 1 choice for the last digit. So a total of $4\\times3\\times2\\times1=24$ choices.\n\nSum the four cases up, we have a total of $4+12+24+24=\\boxed{64}$ numbers.",

    "model_solution": "1. Express the problem as a combination of cases to consider: \n\n   a. Numbers with one digit\n   b. Numbers with two digits\n   c. Numbers with three digits\n   d. Numbers with four digits\n2. For a. Numbers with one digit, there are 4 possibilities since there are 4 different digits to choose from.\n2. For b. Numbers with two digits, we can choose the first digit in 4 ways and the second digit in 3 ways (since we can't repeat a digit), so there are 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 possibilities.\n3. For c. Numbers with three digits, we can choose the first digit in 4 ways, the second digit in 3 ways, and the third digit in 2 ways, so there are 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 24 possibilities.\nFor d. Numbers with four digits, we can choose the first digit in 4 ways, the second digit in 3 ways, the third digit in 2 ways, and the fourth digit in 1 way, so there are 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24 possibilities.\n4. To find the total number of distinct numbers, we add the number of possibilities for each case: 4 (one digit) + 12 (two digits) + 24 (three digits) + 24 (four digits) =\n4 + 12 + 24 + 24 = 64\n5. The total number of distinct numbers Bekah can form is 64.\nThe total number of distinct numbers Bekah can form is 64.\nThe final answer is 64.",
