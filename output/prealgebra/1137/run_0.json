    "problem": "Each of four circles has a radius of 4 inches. A larger circle has an area equal to the total area of the four smaller circles. What is the length of the radius, in inches, of the larger circle?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the length of the radius of a circle is multiplied by a factor of $k$, then the area of the circle is multiplied by a factor of $k^2$.  Since the larger circle has area 4 times greater than that of each smaller circle, the length of its radius is 2 times greater.  Therefore, the length of its radius is $2\\times 4\\text{ inches}=\\boxed{8}$ inches.",
