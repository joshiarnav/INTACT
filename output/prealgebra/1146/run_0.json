    "problem": "It takes $8$ cups of chocolate chips to make $12$ cookies. How many cups of chocolate chips will it take to make $15$ cookies?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The proportion of cups of chocolate chips to cookies is constant and can be simplified as $\\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, if $x$ is the number of cups of chocolate chips it will take to make $15$ cookies, $\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{x}{15}$. Solving for $x$ gives an answer of $\\boxed{10}$ cups.\n\nBy the way, $\\frac{2}{3}$ cup of chips for a cookie? Wowzers.",
