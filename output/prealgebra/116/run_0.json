    "solution": "Because angle $QBP$ measures 14 degrees, we know that angle $ABC$ measures $3\\cdot14=42$ degrees.  Hence, angle $ACB$ measures $180 - 39 - 42 = 99$ degrees.

Since triangle $ABC$ is scalene, the sum of the measures of angles $A$ and $C$ must be greater than $180^\\circ$.\nStep 2:  We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we can set up an equation using the measures of angles $A$, $C$, and $QBP$. We have $\\angle A + \\angle C = 180^\\circ - \\angle QBP = 180^\\circ - 14^\\circ = 166^\\circ$.
