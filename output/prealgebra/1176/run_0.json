    "problem": "On my ping-pong team there are four times as many right-handed boys as left-handed boys.  Of the students on the team who are left-handed, there are twice as many girls as there are boys.  Half of the girls who are on the team are left-handed.  If there are 36 people on the team, how many are right-handed boys? (Assume no player plays ping-pong equally well with both hands.)",

    "solution": "Let the number of left-handed boys be $x$.  Since there are four times as many right-handed boys, the number of right-handed boys is $4x$.  Since there are twice as many left-handed girls as left-handed boys, and there are $x$ left-handed boys, there are $2x$ left-handed girls.
