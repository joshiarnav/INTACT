    "solution": "The measure of each interior angle in a regular $n$-gon is $180(n-2)/n$ degrees.  Therefore, the measure of angle $\\angle BAD$ is $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees and the measure of angle $CAD$ is 108 degrees.  Their difference, $\\angle BAC$, measures $120-108=\\boxed{12\\text{ degrees}}$.",
