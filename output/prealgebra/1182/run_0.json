The results of the survey were:\n\n$\\bullet$ $33$ students played hockey\n\n$\\bullet$ $24$ students played baseball\n\n$\\bullet$ $8$ students played neither hockey nor baseball\n\nHow many of the students surveyed played both hockey and baseball?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since there were $50$ students surveyed in total and $8$ played neither hockey nor baseball, then $42$ students in total played one game or the other.\n\nSince $33$ students played hockey and $24$ students played baseball, and this totals $33+24=57$ students, then there must be $\\boxed{15}$ students who are \"double-counted\", that is who play both sports.",
