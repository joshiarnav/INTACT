At 2:48 the minute hand points at minute 48, which is $\\frac35$ of the way from hour 9 to hour 10.  Therefore, the minute hand is $\\frac35\\cdot 30 = 18^\\circ$ past hour 9, which means it is $30^\\circ - 18^\\circ = 12^\\circ$ shy of hour 10.  This means the minute hand is $2\\cdot 30^\\circ + 12^\\circ = 72^\\circ$ shy of hour 12.\n\nThe hour hand is $\\frac{48}{60} = \\frac45$ of the way from hour 2 to hour 3, so it is $\\frac45\\cdot 30^\\circ = 24^\\circ$ past hour 2.  So, the hour hand is $2\\cdot 30^\\circ + 24^\\circ = 84^\\circ$ past hour 12.\n\nCombining the angles between each hand and hour 12, the angle between the hands is $72^\\circ + 84^\\circ = \\boxed{156^\\circ}$.",

The correct angle should be greater than 144 degrees between the two hands, so the smaller obtuse angle is 360 - 144 = 216 degrees is not the correct angle either.
