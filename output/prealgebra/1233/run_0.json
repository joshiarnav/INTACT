    "problem": "The lengths of two opposite sides of a square are decreased by $40\\%$ while the lengths of the other two sides are increased by $50\\%$ to form a rectangle. By what percent does the square's area decrease?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $A$ be the area of the square. The lengths of one pair of opposite sides was decreased by $40\\%$, so the area became $.6A$. The other pair of sides were increased by $50\\%$, so the area became $1.5\\cdot .6 A = .9A$. Thus, the area decreased by $\\boxed{10}$ percent.",
