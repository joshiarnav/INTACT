    "problem": "Rebecca is thinking of a number greater than $2.74$ and less than $2.75.$ What is Rebecca's number rounded off to the nearest tenth?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are infinitely many numbers between $2.74$ and $2.75,$ so it is impossible to know exactly what number Rebecca is thinking about. However, we know that the hundredths digit of Rebecca's number (when written as a decimal) is 4, since all numbers that are to the left of $2.75$ and to the right of $2.74$ on the number line have a hundredths digit of 4. Our final answer is then $\\boxed{2.7}.$",
