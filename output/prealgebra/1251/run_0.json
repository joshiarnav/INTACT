    "problem": "How many sides would there be in a convex polygon if the sum of all but one of its interior angles is $1070^{\\circ}$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees, so the angle measures in a polygon with 7 sides sum to $180(7-2) = 900$ degrees, which means that the desired polygon has more than 7 sides.  Meanwhile, the angle measures in a polygon with 8 sides sum to $180(8-2) = 1080$ degrees.  So, it's possible that the polygon has $\\boxed{8}$ sides, and that the last angle measures $10^\\circ$.\n\nTo see that this is the only possibility, note that the angle measures in a polygon with 9 sides sum to $180(9-2) = 1260$ degrees.  Therefore, if the polygon has more than 8 sides, then the last interior angle must measure at least $1260^\\circ - 1070^\\circ = 190^\\circ$.  But this is impossible because each interior angle of a convex polygon has measure less than $180^\\circ$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Recall that the sum of all interior angles in a convex polygon with n sides is (n-2)*180 degrees.\nStep 2: Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as n. We know that the sum of all interior angles is (n-2)*180 degrees, and we are given that the sum of all but one of the interior angles is 1070 degrees. Let's denote the last angle as x, then the sum of all angles is x + 1070 = (n-2)*180.\nStep 3: Simplify the equation to find the value of x in terms of n: x = (n - 2) * 180 - 1070.\nStep 4: The polygon has (n - 1) sides, but one angle, so the other angles are all the same. Let y be that other angle, then (n - 2)y = 1070. Since x = (n - 2)*180 - 1070, x = (n - 2)(180 - y). Therefore, (n - 2)y = (n - 2)(180 - y) - 1070, which can be simplified to (n - 2)y = (n - 2)(180 - y) - 1070.\nStep 5: Simplify the equation to find the value of y in terms of n: y = 180 - y\nStep 6: Simplify the equation to find the value of y: y = 180 - y => 2y = 180 => y = 90.\n\nHowever, since this equation can be simplified further, we should continue to the next step.\n\nStep 7: Substitute the value of y into the equation (n - 2)y = 1070 to find the value of n: (n - 2)(90) = 1070.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",
