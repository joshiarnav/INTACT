    "solution": "Since $AP = BP$, right triangle $APB$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Therefore, $AB = AP\\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\angle ABP = 45^\\circ$, so $\\angle DBC = 90^\\circ - 45^\\circ = 45^\\circ$, which means $DBC$ is a 45-45-90 triangle as well.  Since $P$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BD}$, we have $BD = 2BP = 8$ and $PD = BP = 4$.  Since $DBC$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, we have $CD = BD = 8$ and $BC =CD\\sqrt{2} = 8\\sqrt{2}$.  Finally, the perimeter of $ABCDP$ is \\[AB+BC+CD+DP + AP = 4\\sqrt{2}+8\\sqrt{2}+8+4+4 = \\boxed{16+12\\sqrt{2}}.\\]",
