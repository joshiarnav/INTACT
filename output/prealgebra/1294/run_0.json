    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Two supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. Thus the supplement of 50 degrees is $180-50=\\boxed{130}$ degrees.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Recall the definition of a supplement of an angle.\nStep 2: Let the measure of the supplement of the angle be $x$ degrees. Since the sum of an angle and its supplement is $180$ degrees, we have $x + 50 = 180$.\nStep 3: Solve for $x$: $x = 180 - 50 = 130$.\nStep 4: The measure of the supplement of the angle is $x=130$ degrees.\nStep 5: The measure of the supplement of the angle is 130 degrees.\nStep 6: The measure of the supplement of the angle is 130 degrees.\nStep 7: The measure of the supplement of the angle is 130 degrees.\nStep 8: The measure of the supplement of the angle is $\\boxed{130}$ degrees.\nThe final answer is: The measure of the supplement of the angle is $\\boxed{130}$ degrees.",
