    "problem": "Two bicycle racers cross the starting line on a circular track at 12:15 PM. One cyclist takes $12$ minutes per lap, while the other completes a lap every $16$ minutes. Assuming their speeds remain constant, what is the next time they cross the starting line together?  Your answer should be in the form $h:m_1m_2,$ like 3:45.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We seek the least common multiple of $12$ minutes and $16$ minutes. This gives the amount of time that transpires until the two again cross the starting line together. $12=2^2\\cdot 3$ and $16=2^4$, so taking the highest power of each yields $LCM(12,16)=2^4\\cdot 3=48$ minutes, so that the desired time is $48$ minutes past $\\text{12:15 PM}$, or $\\boxed{\\text{1:03 PM}}$.",

The time they cross the starting line is $12 n$ minutes for the first cyclist and $16 m$ minutes for the second cyclist.\nStep 2: We want to find the next time they cross the starting line, which is when $12 n = 16 m.$\nStep 3: The equation $12 n = 16 m$ can be simplified to $3 n = 4 m.$ We can find the smallest positive integer solution by trying to find the smallest values of $n$ and $m$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 4: The smallest positive integer solution is $n=8$ and $m=6$ because $3 \\times 8 = 4 \\times 6.$\nStep 5: The first cyclist will cross the starting line again in $12n=12(8)=96$muches, and the second cyclist will cross the starting line again in $16m=16(6)=96$muches.\nStep 6: They next cross the starting line together after a total of $96$ minutes have passed, so they will cross the starting line together at $12:15$ PM plus $96$ minutes, which is $2:51$ PM.\nThey next cross the starting line together after a total of $96$ minutes have passed, so they will cross the starting line together at $12:15$ PM plus $96$ minutes, which is $2:51$ PM.\nStep 7: They next cross the starting line together at 12:15 PM plus 96 minutes, which is 2:51 PM, so the next time they cross the starting line together is 2:51 PM.\nStep 6: They next cross the starting line together after a total of $96$ minutes have passed, so they will cross the starting line together at $12:15$ PM plus $96$ minutes, which is $2:51$ PM.",
