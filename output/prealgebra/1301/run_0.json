    "problem": "Sharon bought a mixture of nuts that was made up of pecans, walnuts and cashews in a ratio by weight of $2:3:1$, respectively. If she bought $9$ pounds of nuts, how many pounds of walnuts were in the mixture? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the pecan to walnut to cashew ratio is $2:3:1$, it follows that the walnut ratio to all of the nuts is equal to $\\frac{3}{2+3+1} = \\frac 12$. Thus, there were $\\frac 12\\times 9 = \\boxed{4.5}$ pounds of walnuts in the mixture.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let the weight of pecans, walnuts, and cashews be $2x$, $3x$, and $x$ pounds, respectively.\nStep 2: The weight of the mixture is the sum of the weights of pecans, walnuts, and cashews: $2x+3x+x=9$ pounds.\nStep 3: $6x=9$\nStep 4: \\(x=\\frac{9}{6}=\\frac{3}{2}\\)\nStep 5: The weight of walnuts in the mixture is $3x=3\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)=\\frac{9}{2}$ pounds.
