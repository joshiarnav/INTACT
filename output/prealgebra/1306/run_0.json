    "problem": "Three schools have a chess tournament. Four players come from each school. Each player plays three games against each player from the other schools, and plays one game against each other player from his or her own school. How many games of chess are played?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Each player plays $3\\cdot 8 + 3=27$ games of chess, and there are 12 players. If we multiplied 27 by 12 we would count each game twice, so we must divide this number by 2. The total number of games played is $(27 \\cdot 12)/2=\\boxed{162}$.",

But this counts each game twice, so the total number of games is 72 / 2 = 36.\nThere are 12 players, and each plays 6 games. 12 players play 12 x 6 = 72 games.

Since there are 3 schools, each with 4 players, there are 3 x 6 = 18 games played among students from the same school.\n12 schools have 4 players each, so there are 3 x 6 = 18 total games played among students from the same school.\nThere are 12 schools, and each plays 6 games among themselves. Since there are 3 schools, each with 4 players, there are 3 x 6 = total games played among students from the same school is incorrect, and 12 x 4 = 48 students so 48 / 2 = 24 schools play 6 games among themselves.\nTotal games played among students from the same school is 24 x 6 = 144.\nTotal games played among students from the same school is 144. \nThe total number of games is 36 (from previous steps) + 144 = 180.\nThe total number of games is 36 (from previous steps) + 144 = 180.",
