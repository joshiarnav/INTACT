    "problem": "25 students average 84 on a test. Another group of 20 students averages 66. Find the overall average.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To find the overall average, we find the total of all of the students' scores and then divide that sum by the total number of students. The average score is then equal to $$\\frac{(25)(84)+(20)(66)}{25+20}=\\frac{2100+1320}{45}=\\frac{3420}{45}=\\boxed{76}.$$",
