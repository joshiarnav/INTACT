    "problem": "A recipe calls for $3\\frac{4}{5}$ cups of flour. However, Stacy wants to use half as much flour as the recipe calls for. How many cups of flour will Stacy use? Express your answer as a mixed number.",

    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recalling that \"as much\" means \"times\" here and \"half\" means \"1/2,\" we see that Stacy wants to use $\\frac{1}{2}\\times 3\\frac{4}{5}$ cups of flour. To multiply, we first convert $3\\frac45$ to a fraction:  \\[\n3\\frac{4}{5} = 3 + \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{3\\cdot 5}{5} + \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{15}{5} + \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{19}{5}.\n\\]Now we multiply by 1/2:  \\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\frac45 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{19}{5} = \\frac{1\\cdot 19}{2\\cdot 5} = \\frac{19}{10}.\n\\]Finally, we convert 19/10 to a mixed number. When we divide 19 by 10, we get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 9. So \\[\n\\frac{19}{10} = \\frac{10+9}{10} = \\frac{10}{10}+ \\frac{9}{10} = 1 + \\frac{9}{10} = \\boxed{1\\frac{9}{10}}.\n\\]",
