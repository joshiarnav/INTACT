    "problem": "The mean of the increasing ordered set of numbers, $\\{6, x, 22\\}$, is equal to the median. What is the value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The mean of the set is the sum of all the numbers divided by the number of numbers (which is 3), so the mean is $\\frac{6+x+22}{3}$.  The median of the set is the number in the middle when the numbers are written in increasing order, so the median of this set is $x.$  Thus, we have \\[\\frac{6+x+22}{3} = x.\\]  Multiplying both sides by 3 yields $6+x+22 = 3x$, which simplifies to $28 = 2x$ or $x=\\boxed{14}$.",
