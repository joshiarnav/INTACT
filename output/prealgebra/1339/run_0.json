    "problem": "Brass is an alloy created using $80\\%$ copper and $20\\%$ zinc. If Henri's brass trumpet contains 48 ounces of copper, how many ounces of zinc are in the trumpet?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "This means that the trumpet is $\\frac{4}{5}$ copper, and $\\frac{1}{5}$ zinc.  Since there are 48 ounces of copper, and that represents $\\frac{4}{5}$ of the total, we can simply divide by 4 to find the corresponding amount of zinc, making for $\\frac{48}{4} = \\boxed{12}$ ounces of zinc.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let the total amount of brass be represented as x ounces.\nStep 2: Since the brass is made up of $80\\%$ copper, the amount of copper, 48 ounces, represents $80\\%$ of the total amount of brass, so we can write the equation: $0.8x=48$.\nStep 3: Solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.8: $x=48/0.8$.\nStep 4: Calculate the numerical value of $x$ to determine the total amount of brass in the trumpet: $x=48/0.8=60$.\nStep 5: Calculate the amount of zinc by taking 20% of the total amount of brass, which is $0.2x$.\n \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 12.",
