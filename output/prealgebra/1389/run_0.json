    "problem": "A fraction is equivalent to $\\frac{5}{8}.$ Its denominator and numerator add up to $91.$ What is the difference between the denominator and numerator of this fraction?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We obtain fractions equivalent to $\\frac{5}{8}$ by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number.\n\nThe sum of the numerator and denominator of $\\frac{5}{8}$ is $13,$ so when we multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number, the sum of the numerator and denominator is also multiplied by this same number.\n\nSince $91 = 13 \\times 7,$ then we should multiply the numerator and denominator both by $7$ to get a fraction $$\\frac{5\\times 7}{8 \\times 7} = \\frac{35}{56}$$equivalent to $\\frac{5}{8}$ whose numerator and denominator add up to $91.$\n\nThe difference between the denominator and numerator in this fraction is $56-35=\\boxed{21}.$",
