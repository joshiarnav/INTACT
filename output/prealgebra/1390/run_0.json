    "problem": "A square and a right triangle have equal perimeters.  The legs of the right triangle are 20 inches and 15 inches.  What is the area of the square, in square inches?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The legs of the right triangle are in a $3:4$ ratio, so the right triangle is similar to a $3 - 4 - 5$ right triangle and thus it has hypotenuse $5\\cdot 5 = 25$.  The perimeter of the right triangle is then $15 + 20 + 25 = 60$.  Then the square has side length $60/4=15$ and area $15^2 = \\boxed{225}$ square inches.",

    "model_solution": "Find the perimeter of the right triangle by adding the lengths of its legs and hypotenuse.\nFind the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle.\nLet the side length of the square be x inches. Then, the perimeter of the square is 4x inches. Since the square and the triangle have equal perimeters, 4x = 20 + 15 + h, where h is the hypotenuse of the triangle.\nUse the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle, so 20^2 + 15^2 = h^2, then take the square root of both sides to solve for h.\nSolve for h: h = \u221a(20^2 + 15^2) = \u221a(400 + 225) = \u221a625 = 25 inches.\nSubstitute 25 for h in the equation 4x = 20 + 15 + h and solve for x.\nSubstitute 25 for h in the equation 4x = 20 + 15 + h to get 4x = 20 + 15 + 25, then combine like terms to get 4x = 60.\nDivide both sides of the equation 4x = 60 by 4 to solve for x.\nx = 60/4 = 15\nFind the area of the square by squaring the side length of the square, so x^2 = (15)^2.",
