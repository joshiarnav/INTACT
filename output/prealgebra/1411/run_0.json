    "solution": "In symbols, we want the sum of the positive integers $k$ such that $$\\dfrac23 < \\dfrac k{27} < \\dfrac89.$$ Multiplying the expressions in these inequalities by $27$, we have $$18 < k < 24.$$ The integer solutions are thus $k = 19,20,21,22,23$, which add up to $5\\cdot 21 = \\boxed{105}$.",
