    "solution": "Since we are told there are $15$ numbers in the first $5$ Rows, we want to find the $15^{\\mathrm{th}}$ number starting with the first number in Row 6. Since there are $6$ numbers in Row 6, there are $7$ numbers in Row 7 and there are $8$ numbers in Row 8, the $15^{\\mathrm{th}}$ number if we start counting in Row 6 is located at the $2^{\\mathrm{nd}}$ spot of Row 8, which is of course an $\\boxed{8}.$",
