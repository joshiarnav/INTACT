    "problem": "Sallie earned a grade of exactly $90 \\%$ for a marking period based on six equally weighed tests. The four test papers she can find have grades of exactly $83 \\%$, $96 \\%$, $81 \\%$, and $82\\%$. What is the sum of the percent scores of the two missing grades?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Suppose each test is worth $x$ points.  Then on the tests Sallie found, she has a total of $.83x + .96x + .81 x + .82x = 3.42 x$ points.  In all, she earned $6\\cdot .9x = 5.4 x$ points.  Thus, on the two remaining tests she scored $1.98x$ points, which is a total of $\\boxed{198\\%}$.",

We are given the grades for four of the six tests: $83 \\%$, $96 \\%$, $81 \\%$, and $82 \\%$.\nStep 2:  To find the sum of the percent scores of the two missing grades, we need to first figure out the total points earned from the six equally weighed tests.\nStep 3:  Since there are six equally weighed tests and the total score is $90 \\%$, we can calculate the total points earned as follows: $6 \\times 90 = 540$. This gives us $540$ points as the total.\nStep 4:  Now, we can add up the points from the four given test papers: $83 + 96 + 81 + 82 = 342$. This gives us a total of $342$ points from the four known test papers.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the total points earned from the remaining two test papers can be calculated by subtracting $342$ from $540$, giving us $540 - 342 = 198$ points for the two missing tests.\nStep 2: Divide 198 by 2 to find the score of one of the missing grades, since the scores of the two missing tests are equally weighted.\n198/2 = 99\nSince the scores of the two missing tests are equally weighted, the sum of their percent scores is double the score of one of the missing grades, which is $99$.\nStep 3: $2 \\times 99 = 198$\n$2 \\times 99 = 198$\nStep 4: $2 \\times 99 = 198$\nStep 5: $2 \\times 99 = 198$\n$2 \\times 99 = 198$",
