    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The first positive odd integer is 1.  To get to the 2004th positive odd integer, we must add 2 exactly 2003 times.  Make sure you see why it's not 2004 times -- that would give us the 2005th positive odd integer, just like adding one 2 to 1 gives us the second positive odd integer, not the first.  Therefore, our answer is $1 + 2003\\cdot 2 = \\boxed{4007}$.",
