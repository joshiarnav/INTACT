    "solution": "Consider each of the answer choices individually.\nA. $43$ is between $40$ and $40+10=50$. Since $3$ is less than $5$, $43$ rounds down to ${\\bf 40}$.\nB. $23$ is between $20$ and $20+10=30$, so it cannot round to $40$.\nC. $38$ is between $30$ and $30+10=40$. Because $8$ is greater than or equal to $5$, $38$ rounds up to ${\\bf 40}$.\nD. $51$ is between $50$ and $50+10=60$, so it cannot round to $40$.\nE. $45$ is between $40$ and $40+10=50$. $5$ is greater than or equal to $5$, so $45$ rounds up to $50$.\nF. $35$ is between $30$ and $30+10=40$. $5$ is greater than or equal to $5$, so $35$ rounds up to ${\\bf 40}$.\nThe answer choices that round up to $40$ are A, C, and F. The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{ACF}}$.",
