    "problem": "Annie's soccer team is conducting a passing drill in which each of the 11 members of the soccer team must pass the ball to each of the other members exactly three times. How many times must the ball be passed before the passing drill is over?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "A soccer pass differs from a handshake in that Person A passing the ball to Person B is clearly different from Person B passing the ball to Person A. Therefore, there are $11$ members of the team who can pass the ball to $10$ other members, meaning that there are $11 \\cdot 10 = 110$ possible passes between two members of the team. Each member must pass the ball to each of the other members three times, so we multiply $110$ by $3$ to obtain $\\boxed{330},$ our answer.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Calculate the number of passes per player to other players.\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of passes per player to other players.\nEach player passes to 10 other players, and this occurs 3 times. So there are 10 * 3 = 30 passes per player.\nStep 3: Multiply the total number of passes per player by the total number of players to get the total number of passes, then divide by 2 to eliminate double counting.\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of passes. Total passes = (30 passes/player) * (11 players) = 330 passes. Divide by 2 to eliminate double counting: 330 / 2 = 165.\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of passes.
