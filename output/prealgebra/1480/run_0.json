    "problem": "The arithmetic mean of eight positive integers is 7. If one of the eight integers is removed, the mean becomes 6. What is the value of the integer that is removed?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the mean of the eight integers is 7, then the sum of those eight integers is $8 \\cdot 7=56$. If the mean of the seven remaining numbers is 6, then the sum of those numbers is $7 \\cdot 6=42$. Thus, the removed number is $56-42=\\boxed{14}$",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let x be the value of the integer that is removed, and let the sum of the other seven integers be y. Then, x + y = 56.\nStep 2: After removing the integer x, the sum of the remaining seven integers is y, so their mean is y/7 = 6, which implies y = 42.\nStep 3: The value of x can be found by substituting y = 42 into the equation x + y = 56, which gives x = 14.\nSince we have already found the value of x in Step 3, this is the Final Answer.",
