    "problem": "If $4$ wands are equivalent to $6$ rands and $24$ rands are equivalent to $8$ fands, how many wands are equivalent to $5$ fands?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We can set up a proportion to find the ratio of wands to fands. $$\\frac{4 \\text{ wands}}{6 \\text{ rands}}\\times\\frac{24 \\text{ rands}}{8 \\text{ fands}}=\\frac{2 \\text{ wands}}{3 \\text{ rands}}\\times\\frac{3 \\text{ rands}}{1 \\text{ fand}}=\\frac{2 \\text{ wands}}{1 \\text{ fand}}$$ Now we multiply the ratio of wands to fands by the number of fands.  $$\\frac{2 \\text{ wands}}{1 \\text{ fand}}\\times 5\\text{ fands}=10\\text{ wands}$$ The answer is $\\boxed{10}$ wands.",
