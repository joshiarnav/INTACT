    "problem": "What is the smallest integer greater than 200 for which the greatest common divisor of that integer and 36 is 18?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3. If the greatest common factor with 36 is 18, that means the other number is a multiple of 18, containing the factors 2, 3, and 3 but not a second 2. The smallest multiple of 18 that is greater than 200 is $18(12)=216$, which does not work since the 12 contains a second 2. The next smallest multiple is $18(13)=234$, which does not contain a second 2. So, our answer is $\\boxed{234}$.",

Since the smallest multiple of $2^1$ greater than 200 is 202, and the smallest multiple of $3^2$ greater than 200 is 225, the smallest integer that meets this condition is the product of 202 and 225 divided by their greatest common divisor, 3.\nStep 4:  $\\frac{202 \\cdot 225}{3} = \\frac{45250}{3} = 15083.\\overline{3}$\nStep 5: \n$\\frac{202 \\cdot 225}{3} = \\frac{45250}{3} = 15083.\\overline{3}$\n$15083 \\cdot 3 = 45249$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 45249.",
