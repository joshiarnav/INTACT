    "problem": "The five-digit number $N = 14{,}9AB$ is divisible by 12. Given that $A$ and $B$ are nonzero digits, what is the smallest possible value of $N$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In order for $N$ to be divisible by 12, $N$ must be divisible by $4$ and $3$. That means the last two digits $AB$ must form a multiple of $4.$ Since $A$ and $B$ are nonzero digits, the smallest possible $14{,}9AB$ that is divisible by 4 is $14{,}912.$ Unfortunately, this number is not a multiple of $3$, since $1 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 2 = 17.$ However, our next possibility, $14{,}916,$ is a multiple of $3,$ since $1 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 6 = 21.$ Therefore, $\\boxed{14{,}916}$ is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  To find the smallest possible value of the five-digit number $N = 14{,}9AB$ that is divisible by 12, we must first consider the requirements for divisibility by 12. A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4. To be divisible by 3, the sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 3. To be divisible by 4, the last two digits of the number must be divisible by 4.\nStep 2:  To meet the divisibility requirement of 3, we need to find a suitable value for $A$ such that the sum of the digits $1+4+9+A$ is divisible by 3.\nStep 3:  We'll start by finding the smallest value of $A$ that makes $1+4+9+A$ divisible by 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
