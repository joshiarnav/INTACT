    "problem": "Daphne has a rope that is 60 meters long. She wants to use it to mark the boundary of a circle whose radius is an integer. What's the largest possible radius for her circle, in meters?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The 60-meter rope will mark the circumference of the circle, which is equal to $2\\pi r$. So we look for the largest integer $r$ such that the circumference is less than or equal to 60. We have $$2\\pi r\\le60\\qquad\\implies r\\le\\frac{60}{2\\pi}\\approx \\frac{30}{3.14}.$$We know that $\\frac{30}{3.14}<\\frac{31.4}{3.14}=10$, but greater than $\\frac{31.4-3.14}{3.14}=9$, so the largest possible radius is $\\boxed{9}$ meters.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Recognize that the length of the rope is equal to the circumference of the circle, since it will be used to mark the boundary of the circle.\nStep 2: Recall the formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2 * \u03c0 * r. Given that the circumference is equal to the length of the rope (60 meters), we can set up the equation: 60 = 2 * \u03c0 * r.\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 * \u03c0 to isolate r, giving r = 60 / (2 * \u03c0).\nStep 4: Calculate the value of r using the approximate value of \u03c0 as 3.14, giving r = 60 / (2 * 3.14) = 60 / 6.28.\nStep 5: Calculate the value of r, rounding down to the nearest integer, since the radius must be an integer.\nStep 6: Calculate the value of r, which is approximately 9.55, round down to the nearest integer to get r = 9.\nStep 7: The largest integer less than 9.55 is 9, so the largest possible radius for her circle is 9 meters.\nStep 6: Calculate the value of r, which is approximately 9.55, round down to the nearest integer to get r = 9.",
