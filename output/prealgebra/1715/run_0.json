    "problem": "The only garments that a particular factory produces are  dresses and shirts. It produces three\tdresses for every five shirts  it makes. If the factory produced a total of 72 garments today,  how many dresses did it make?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the factory produces 3 dresses for every 5 shirts, that means it produces 3 dresses out of every 8 garments. So we multiply the fraction $\\frac{3}{8}$ by the number of garments, 72, and get $\\frac{3}{8}\\cdot72=3\\cdot9=\\boxed{27}$ dresses.",
