    "solution": "If four typists can type 600 memos in three days, they can type 200 memos in one day. Three typists can type $3/4$ of the memos in one day, or $200\\cdot \\frac{3}{4}=\\boxed{150}$ memos.",

Since they type 600 memos in 3 days, their daily rate is (600 memos)/(3 days) = 200 memos per day. We divide this by 4 to get the rate per typist: 200/4=50 memos per day.
