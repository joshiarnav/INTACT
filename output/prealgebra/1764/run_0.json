    "problem": "It is a beautiful day at the beach and ten beach volleyball players have shown up at the volleyball courts. Each two-person volleyball team should consist of a setter and a spiker. Five of the players prefer to be a spiker, four of the players prefer to be a setter, and one player is fine either way.\n\nIn how many ways can a two-person team be assembled such that no player feels out of position?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Each of the five spikers can be matched with any of the four setters to make $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ possible teams.\n\nThe one player who is fine either way can be matched with any of the nine other players to make $9$ possible teams.\n\nTherefore, there are $20 + 9 = \\boxed{29}$ possible teams in which no player feels out of position.",

For the setter position, we can choose one out of the remaining 9 players (1 player who is fine either way + 4 players who prefer to be setters - 1 player who is already chosen as a spiker) in $\\binom{9}{1}=9$ ways.\nStep 3: \nMultiply the number of ways to select the spiker and the number of ways to select the setter. $5 \\times 9 = 45$\nSince the player who is fine either way can be either a spiker or a setter, we must multiply the result from step 3 by 2.\n$2 \\times 45 = 90$\nStep 4: \n$90 \\times 2 = 180$\nStep 5:\n$180 \\times 1 = 180$\n\nFinal Answer.",
