    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since $4+2+7+8+9+3+7=40$, the single-digit replacements for $n$ that make the sum divisible by 3 are $2$, $5$, or $8$. The sums would be $42$, $45$, and $48$, respectively, which are all multiples of 3. Therefore, the sum of all single-digit replacements for $n$ is $2+5+8=\\boxed{15}$.",
