    "problem": "When a spaceship full of scientists landed on Planet Q, they found that $\\frac{17}{40}$ of the $160$ aliens had $3$ eyes.  How many aliens had $3$ eyes?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Remembering that \"of\" means \"times,\" the number of aliens with 3 eyes is $\\frac{17}{40} \\cdot 160$.  This equals $\\frac{17 \\cdot 160}{40}$, which can be rewritten as $17 \\cdot \\frac{160}{40}$.  Because $160$ divided by $40$ equals $4$, the expression above is the same as $17 \\cdot 4$, which equals $\\boxed{68}$.",
