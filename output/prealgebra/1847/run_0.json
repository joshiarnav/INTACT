    "problem": "The shape of the sign outside Bob's Burger Barn is a regular octagon. How many degrees are in the measure of an interior angle of this sign?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the angle measures in a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  So, the sum of the octagon's angles is $180(8-2) = 1080$ degrees.  The polygon is regular, so all the angles have the same measure, which means each is $\\frac{1080^\\circ}{8} = \\boxed{135^\\circ}$.",
