    "problem": "Kelly can read five pages of her fiction book or two pages of her history textbook in seven minutes. If Kelly wants to read thirty pages of each book, for how many minutes in total must Kelly read?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Thirty pages of a fiction book is six sets of five pages, so it will take $6\\times 7 = 42$ minutes to read the fiction book. Likewise, thirty pages of a history textbook is fifteen sets of two pages, so it will take $15\\times 7 = 105$ minutes to read the history textbook. In total, this will be $42+105 = \\boxed{147}$ minutes.",
