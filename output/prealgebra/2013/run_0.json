    "problem": "Amy, Betty, Cathy, and Daisy have $36$ apples that they plan to split among themselves in a ratio of $2:3:3:4$, respectively. How many apples will Betty and Cathy have together?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The four girls are dividing the $36$ apples into $2+3+3+4 = 12$ equal parts. Thus, there are $\\frac{36}{12} = 3$ apples per part. Together, Betty and Cathy have $3+3 = 6$ parts, so they will have $3 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{18}$ apples.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Add the parts of the ratio that belong to Betty and Cathy: 3 + 3 = 6\nStep 2: Multiply the total number of parts in the ratio by the number of apples chosen to find the total number of apples: $36 = 12x$, so $x = 3$.\nStep 3: Multiply the number of apples that Betty and Cathy have by the value of x: 6 $\\times$ 3 = 18\nStep 4: Betty and Cathy will have 18 apples together.\nThere is no next step in solving the problem.
