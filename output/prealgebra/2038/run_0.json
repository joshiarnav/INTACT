    "problem": "The ratio of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 3:2:1. Given that the shortest side of the triangle is 12 meters long, what is the number of meters in the longest side of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the ratio of the angle measures is $3:2:1$, the angles have measures $3x$, $2x$, and $x$ for some value of $x$.  The angle measures of a triangle sum to $180^\\circ$, so we have $3x+2x+x = 180^\\circ$.  Simplifying gives $6x=180^\\circ$, so $x=30^\\circ$.  Therefore, the angle measures are $90^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $30^\\circ$, which means the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle.  In such a triangle, the hypotenuse has twice the length of the leg opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle, so the hypotenuse of the triangle in the problem has length $2\\cdot 12 = \\boxed{24}$ meters.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Since the ratio of the measures of the angles of the triangle is given, the corresponding sides must also be in the same ratio, as per the angle-side relationship of triangles.\nStep 2: Let's use the variable x to represent the unknowns in the ratio, so the sides are 3x, 2x, and x. Since the shortest side is given as 12 meters, we can equate 2x to 12 and solve for x.\nStep 3: Solve for x: 2x = 12, x = 6.\nStep 4: Substitute x back into the expression for the longest side, which is 3x, to find its length: 3(6) = 18.\nStep 5: The length of the longest side is 18 meters.\nStep 4: Substitute x back into the expression for the longest side, which is 3x, to find its length: 3(6) = 18.",
