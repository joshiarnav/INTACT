    "problem": "The perfect squares from $1$ through $2500,$ inclusive, are printed in a sequence of digits $1491625\\ldots2500.$ How many digits are in the sequence?",

    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We consider it by four cases:\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 1: There are $3$ perfect squares that only have $1$ digit, $1^{2},$ $2^{2},$ and $3^{2}.$\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 2: The smallest perfect square that has $2$ digits is $4^{2},$ and the largest is $9^{2},$ so that's a total of $6$ perfect squares with $2$ digits.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 3: The smallest perfect square with $3$ digits is $10^{2},$ and the largest is $31^{2},$ yielding a total of $22.$\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 4: The smallest perfect square with $4$ digits is $32^{2},$ and the last one that is no greater than $2500$ is $50^{2},$ giving a total of $19.$\n\nSo we have a total of $1\\times3+2\\times6+3\\times22+4\\times19=\\boxed{157}$ digits.",

The total number of digits is $50\\cdot1+25\\cdot2+16\\cdot3+9\\cdot4+4\\cdot5+1\\cdot6.$\nStep 4:  Evaluate the expression $50\\cdot1+25\\cdot2+16\\cdot3+9\\cdot4+4\\cdot5+1\\cdot6.$\nStep 4: $50\\cdot1+25\\cdot2+16\\cdot3+9\\cdot4+4\\cdot5+1\\cdot6 = 50 + 50 + 48 + 36 + 20 + 6 = 210$\nStep 4: The final answer is: $\\boxed{210}$",
