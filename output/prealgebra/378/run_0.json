    "solution": "The total area of the rectangle is $3 \\times 4 =12$.\n\nThe total area of the shaded regions equals the total area of the rectangle (12) minus the area of the unshaded region.\n\nThe unshaded region is a triangle with base of length 1 and height 4; the area of this region is $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(4)=2$.\n\nTherefore, the total area of the shaded regions is $12 - 2 = \\boxed{10}$.",
