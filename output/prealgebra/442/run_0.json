    "problem": "What is the 1000th digit to the right of the decimal point when $\\frac{4}{15}$ is expressed as a decimal?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{4}{15}=0.2\\overline{6}$. Therefore, every digit to the right of the decimal point besides the $2$ in the tenths place will be $6$. The 1000th digit to the right of the decimal point is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: To solve this problem, first express $\\frac{4}{15}$ as a decimal using long division.\nStep 2: Based on the long division, we can see that $\\frac{4}{15}$ can be expressed as the repeating decimal $0.2666666\\dots$. The repeating block has a length of $1$.\nStep 3: Divide 1000 by 1, the length of the repeating block, to find the remainder. If the remainder is 0 then the 1000th digit is the last digit of the repeating block, and if the remainder is not 0, find the digit at the remainderth position in the repeating block.\nStep 4: Since the remainder is 0, the 1000th digit is the last digit of the repeating block.\nStep 4: The 1000th digit is the last digit of the repeating block, which is 6.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",
