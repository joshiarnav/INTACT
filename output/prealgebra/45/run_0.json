    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Writing out the prime factorization of $144$ and $405$, we see that $144 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2$ and $405 = 3^4 \\cdot 5$. Their greatest common factor is $3^2 = \\boxed{9}$.\n\nAlternatively, since $405$ is odd, we know that we can ignore any factors of $2$ in $144$. Dividing by $2$ repeatedly, we find that $144/2^4 = 9$. Since $9$ divides into $405$, it follows that the greatest common factor is $9$.",
