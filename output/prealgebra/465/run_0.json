    "problem": "When converting $\\frac{31}{11111}$ to a decimal, the decimal turns out to be a repeating decimal. How many digits repeat in this repeating decimal?\n\nFor example, if you get the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{123},$ then your answer should be $3,$ and if you get $0.436\\overline{7},$ your answer should be $1.$",

    "solution": "We begin by noting that    $$\\frac{31}{11111} = \\frac{31 \\times 9}{11111 \\times 9} = \\frac{279}{99999}.$$We will show that   $$\\frac{279}{99999} = 0.\\overline{00279},$$so our final answer is $\\boxed{5}.$\n\nProof that $279/99999 = 0.\\overline{00279}$:\n\nLet $s = 0.\\overline{00279}$. Then multiplying both sides $10^5$ gives   $$10^5 s = 279.\\overline{00279}.$$Subtracting the left side by $s$ and the right side by $0.\\overline{00279}$ gives   $$99999s = 279,$$so $s = 279/99999$. It follows that $0.\\overline{00279} = 279 / 99999,$ as desired.",

We need to determine the length of this repeating pattern.\nStep 3:  Since $11111$ is a divisor of $10^5 - 1 = 99999$, we can express $\\frac{31}{11111}$ as $\\frac{3}{10^4 + 1}$ using this relationship.\nStep 4:  Next, we can express $\\frac{3}{10^4 + 1}$ as $\\frac{3}{99999}$, which can be further simplified to $\\frac{3}{10^5 - 1}$.\n\nFinal Answer.",
