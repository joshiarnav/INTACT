    "problem": "The length of a rectangle is twice its width. Given the length of the diagonal is $5\\sqrt{5}$, find the area of the rectangle.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the width of the rectangle be $w$. Then the length of the rectangle is $2w$. We can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to two sides of this rectangle and get that the length of the diagonal is $5\\sqrt{5}=\\sqrt{w^2+(2w)^2}=\\sqrt{5 w^2}$. We therefore have $5\\sqrt{5} = w\\sqrt{5}$, which means that $w=5$. This means that the length of the rectangle is 10, so its area is $5\\cdot10=\\boxed{50}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let w be the width of the rectangle; the length is 2w.\nStep 2: Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the relationship between the width, length, and diagonal: $w^{2} + (2w)^{2} = (5\\sqrt{5})^{2}$\nStep 3: $w^{2} + 4w^{2} = 125$\nStep 4: $5w^{2} = 125$\nStep 5: $w^{2} = 25$\nStep 6: $w = 5$\nStep 7: The length is 2w, so length = 2(5) = 10; the area is length times width, so area = 10 * 5 = 50.
