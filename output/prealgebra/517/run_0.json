    "problem": "At 3:20, what is the degree measure of the acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand on a 12-hour analog clock?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The hour hand is $\\frac{20}{60}=\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way from the 3 o'clock to the 4 o'clock position, so it has moved $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12}\\cdot 360^\\circ=10$ degrees past the 3 o'clock position.  The minute hand is in the 4 o'clock position, so it has moved $\\frac{1}{12}\\cdot 360^\\circ=30$ degrees past the 3 o'clock position.  The angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is $30-10=\\boxed{20}$ degrees.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Identify the positions of the hour and minute hands at 3:20. \nThe hour hand is at 3 and the minute hand is at 12.\nStep 2: Calculate the angle moved by the hour hand from the 3 o'clock position. The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours or 30 degrees per hour. In 20 minutes, it moves an additional (30 degrees/hour) * (20/60) hours = 10 degrees.\nStep 3: Calculate the total angle between the hour and minute hands. The angle between the hour hand and the 3 o'clock position is 30 degrees. Since the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, the total angle between the hour and minute hands is 30 + 10 = 40 degrees. However, this is not the acute angle. The acute angle can be found by subtracting 40 from 360.\nStep 4: Subtract the total angle from 360 to find the acute angle: 360 - 40 = 320 degrees.\nStep 5: The previous calculation resulted in an obtuse angle, but we want the acute angle. The correct acute angle can be found by subtracting the calculated angle from 360: 360 - 320 = 40 degrees.\nStep 6: Since 40 degrees is less than 180 degrees, it is the acute angle formed by the hour and minute hands.\nStep 4: Subtract the total angle from 360 to find the acute angle: 360 - 40 = 320 degrees.",
