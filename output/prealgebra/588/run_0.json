    "problem": "There are 42 people in pilates class.  Today, 36 of them brought yoga mats, 26 of them brought eco-friendly water bottles, and 20 of them remembered to bring both yoga mats and water bottles.  How many people had to suffer through class having neither a yoga mat nor a water bottle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We can solve this with a Venn diagram.  First we notice that there are 20 people with both yoga mats and water bottles. [asy]\nlabel(\"Yoga Mat\", (2,75));\nlabel(\"Water Bottle\", (80,75));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$20$\", (44, 45));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$33$\",(28,45));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$23$\",(63,45));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$17$\", (70, 15));\n[/asy] Since 36 people brought yoga mats and 20 of those people brought water bottles too, $36-20=16$ of the people have yoga mats but not water bottles.  Likewise, $26-20=6$ people brought water bottles but not yoga mats. [asy]\nlabel(\"Yoga Mat\", (2,75));\nlabel(\"Water Bottle\", (80,75));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$20$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$16$\",(28,45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$6$\",(63,45));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$17$\", (70, 15));\n[/asy] This means that $16+20+6=42$ people brought at least one of the two items.  That's everybody!  Therefore $\\boxed{0}$ people had to suffer without a water bottle or yoga mat.",
