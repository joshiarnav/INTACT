    "solution": "To start, find a common denominator on the left side.  The lowest common multiple of 7 and 3 is 21, so this is the common denominator.  Rewrite the equation as: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{3x}{21}+\\frac{7x}{21} &= 1 - x \\\\\n\\frac{10x}{21} &= 1 - x \\\\\n\\end{align*}We now multiply both sides by $21$ to get $10x = 21 - 21x,$ then $31x = 21.$ So $x = \\boxed{\\frac{21}{31}}.$",
