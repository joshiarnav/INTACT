    "problem": "How many six-inch by six-inch square tiles are needed to cover a three-foot by two-foot rectangular section of floor?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are $12$ inches in a foot, so the length of the rectangular section of floor is $36$ inches and its width is $24$ inches. It would take $36 \\div 6 = 6$ tiles to cover the length of the floor and $24 \\div 6 = 4$ tiles to cover the width, so a total of $6 \\times 4 = \\boxed{24}$ tiles are needed to cover the whole rectangular section of the floor.",
