    "solution": "There are 10 possibilities for the first digit. After the first digit has been chosen, there are 9 possibilities for the second digit.  After these two digits have been chosen, there are 8 possibilities for the third digit and after the first three digits have been chosen there are 7 possibilities for the last digit.
