    "solution": "The formula for the area of a triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.  Using this, we can find the length of $AB$, because we know the area of triangle $ABE$. $$6=\\frac{1}{2}AB\\times4$$$$12=AB\\times4$$$$AB=3$$Since $AB=BC=CD$, $AC=2\\times{AB}=6$.\n\nTo find $CE$, use the Pythagorean Theorem, treating $CE$ as the hypotenuse of triangle $ACE$. $$4^2+6^2=CE^2$$$$CE^2=52$$Then $CE = \\sqrt{52}.$  Rounded to the nearest tenth, this is $\\boxed{7.2}.$",
