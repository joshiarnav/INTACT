    "problem": "Tamantha wants to buy boxes in which to put her 77 compact discs. If each box holds 12 discs, how many does she need to buy?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Suppose Tamantha buys $n$ boxes. Since $n$ boxes will hold $12n$ discs, Tamantha will only be able to store all her discs if $12n \\ge 77$.\n\nDividing both sides of this inequality by $12$ gives $n\\ge \\frac{77}{12}$, which we can write as $n\\ge 6\\frac{5}{12}$. Tamantha can only buy a whole number of boxes, so the smallest number that will work is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "Divide 77 compact discs by 12 discs per box.\nRound the quotient to the nearest whole number.\nDetermine if the quotient, after rounding to the nearest whole number, is greater than or equal to the number of compact discs.\nSince the quotient is less than the number of compact discs, Tamantha needs to buy more boxes.
