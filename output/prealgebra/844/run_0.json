    "solution": "The reciprocal of $\\frac{5}{6}$ is $\\frac{6}{5}$.  The reciprocal of the reciprocal  of $\\frac{5}{6}$ must then be the reciprocal of $\\frac{6}{5}$, which is $\\frac{5}{6}$.  Thus, the reciprocal of $\\frac{5}{6}$ divided by the reciprocal of the reciprocal of $\\frac{5}{6}$ is $\\frac{6}{5}\\div\\frac{5}{6}=\\frac{6}{5}\\cdot\\frac{6}{5}=\\boxed{\\frac{36}{25}}$.",
