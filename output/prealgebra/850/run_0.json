    "problem": "At the beginning of the day, Margaret had 72 ice cream cones. By noon, she had $\\frac{2}{3}$ as many cones as she had at the beginning of the day.

    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To find out how many ice cream cones Margaret had at noon, we multiply $\\frac{2}{3}$ by 72. Since 72 is divisible by 3, we can simplify $\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot 72$ by re-writing it as $2\\cdot \\frac{72}{3}$, which equals $2\\cdot 24=48.$ To find how many ice cream cones she had at the end of the day, we multiply $\\frac{2}{3}$ by 48 to find \\[\n\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot 48 = \\frac{2\\cdot 48}{3} = 2\\cdot \\frac{48}{3} = 2\\cdot 16 = \\boxed{32}.\n\\]",
