    "problem": "A 10-by-12-inch page has margins of 1.5 inches on all sides. What fraction of the area of the page is taken up by the margins? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "A 10-by-12-inch paper will have an area of $10 \\cdot 12 = 120$ square inches. If that paper has 1.5 inch margins on all sides, then the portion of the paper that is not covered by margins will be a rectangular section with length $12 - 2(1.5) = 9$ inches and width $10 - 2(1.5) = 7$ inches. Thus, $9 \\cdot 7 = 63$ square inches of the paper will not be taken up by the margins. Since the paper has a total area of $120$ square in, this means that $120-63=57$ square inches of the page is taken up by margins. Thus, margins take up $\\dfrac{57}{120}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{19}{40}}$ of the page.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let's calculate the area of the page and the area taken up by the margins. First, we need to find the dimensions of the page after the margins have been accounted for. \n\n- Inner page width = 12 - 2(1.5) = 9 inches \n- Inner page length = 10 - 2(1.5) = 8 inches\nStep 2: The area of the inner page is 9 * 8 = 72 square inches, and the area of the entire page is 12 * 10 = 120 square inches.\nStep 3: The fraction of the area taken up by the margins is (Area of entire page - Area of inner page) / Area of entire page = (120 - 72) / 120 = 48/120.\nStep 4: Simplify the fraction 48/120 to its simplest form.\nFind the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 48 and 120.\nStep 5: GCD(48, 120) = 24. Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCD: (48 \u00f7 24) / (120 \u00f7 24) = 2/5.\nStep 6: The fraction of the area taken up by the margins is 2/5.\nStep 4: Simplify the fraction 48/120 to its simplest form.",
