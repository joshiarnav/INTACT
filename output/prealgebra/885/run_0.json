    "problem": "In how many ways can a 2-person committee be chosen from a group of 5 people (where the order in which we choose the 2 people doesn't matter)?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We have to choose 2 people, but the order in which we choose the people doesn't matter.  So again, there are 5 ways to choose the first person, then 4 ways to choose second person.  However, we have overcounted, since choosing person A first and person B second will give us the same committee as choosing person B first and person A second.  Each committee is counted twice in our original $5 \\times 4$ count, so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcount, giving us $(5 \\times 4)/2 = \\boxed{10}$ ways to choose a 2-person committee from 5 people.",
