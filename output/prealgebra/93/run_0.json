    "problem": "A world-record swimmer and a dolphin compete in a 400-meter race. The swimmer swims at a rate of 2 meters per second, and the dolphin swims at a rate of 8 meters per second. When the dolphin crosses the finish line, how many meters is the swimmer from the finish line?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The dolphin swims four times faster than the swimmer, so it covers four times the distance in a given time. So when the dolphin has swum 400 meters to get to the finish line, the swimmer has swum $400/4=100$ meters, and is thus $400-100=\\boxed{300}$ meters from the finish line.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the time it takes for the dolphin to cross the finish line by dividing the distance of the race (400 meters) by the dolphin's rate of speed (8 meters per second).\nStep 2: Determine the distance the swimmer has traveled by multiplying the swimmer's rate of speed (2 meters per second) by the time found in Step 1.\nStep 3: Subtract the distance the swimmer has traveled from the total distance of the race to determine how far the swimmer is from the finish line.\nStep 2: 400 \u00f7 8 = 50 seconds; 50 seconds \u00d7 2 meters/second = 100 meters\nStep 3: 400 - 100 = 300 meters\nThe final answer is: 300",
