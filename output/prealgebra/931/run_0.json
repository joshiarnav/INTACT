    "problem": "Simone has a collection of coins consisting of 1 quarter, 1 nickel and 1 penny. Using at least two coins from the collection, how many different sums of money are possible?",

    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are two ways to form a sum: either by leaving out one coin or by not leaving out any. There are three options if we want to leave out one coin, and obviously only one way to not leave out any, so that gives us our answer of $3+1=\\boxed{4}$.",
