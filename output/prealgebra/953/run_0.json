    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We have the ratio $$0.5 \\text{ cm on the map} : 1 \\text{ km in reality}.$$ Multiplying both parts by 2, we have the equivalent ratio $$1 \\text{ cm on the map} : 2 \\text{ km in reality}.$$ Multiplying both parts by 4, we find the equivalent ratio$$4 \\text{ cm on the map} : 8 \\text{ km in reality}.$$ Thus, the cities are $\\boxed{8}$ kilometers apart in reality.",
