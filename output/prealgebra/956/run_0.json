    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the numbers is $5(10.6)=53$.  The sum of the four given numbers is $10+4+5+20=39$.  So the fifth number is $53-39=\\boxed{14}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: The average of five numbers is the sum of the five numbers divided by 5.\nStep 2: The sum of the five numbers is 5 times the average, which is 5 * 10.6 = 53.\nStep 3: The sum of the four known numbers is 10 + 4 + 5 + 20 = 39. Subtracting this sum from the total sum of the five numbers will give the value of the fifth number.\nStep 4: 53 - 39 = 14.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$",
