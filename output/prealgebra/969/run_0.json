    "problem": "A 5-inch by 7-inch picture is placed on a rectangular piece of red paper such that a 0.5-inch wide red border is seen along each side of the picture. What is the area of the visible red border, in square inches?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The piece of red paper must have dimensions of 6 inches by 8 inches in order to have a 0.5 inch border on each side. The area of the paper is 48 square inches, of which $5\\cdot 7 = 35$ square inches are obscured by the picture. Therefore, the area of the visible red border is $48 - 35 = \\boxed{13}$ square inches.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: The dimensions of the picture with the red border are 7 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 8 inches by 5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 6 inches, and the area of this larger rectangle is 8 * 6 square inches.\nStep 2: The area of the visible red border is the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the picture itself, which is 8 * 6 - 5 * 7 square inches.\nStep 3: 8 * 6 - 5 * 7 = 48 - 35 = 13.\nStep 4: 13\nStep 4: The final answer is 13.",
