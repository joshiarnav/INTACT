    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The two lengths of 6 units must be the two bases of the right triangle, because the hypotenuse in a right triangle must be longer than each base. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6\\cdot6}{2}=\\boxed{18}$ square units.",

Since this is an isosceles right triangle, the hypotenuse will be the side opposite the right angle, and it can be found using the formula $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs. Let $a = b = 6$.\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse length\n$c = \\sqrt{6^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{72} = \\sqrt{36 \\times 2} = 6 \\sqrt{2}.$\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the triangle\nThe area of a right triangle can be found using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs. In this case, $a = b = 6$, so the area is $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 6 = 18.$\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of the triangle using the given information\n$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 6 = 18.$\n## Step 6: There is no need to calculate anything else since we have already calculated the area.\nNo Final Answer",
