    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Mark buys $7$ pencils, and a pencil costs $p$ dollars, so the total cost of all of the pencils is $7\\cdot p$ dollars. He buys $3$ more pencils than erasers, so he buys $4$ erasers. Each eraser costs $e$ dollars, so the total cost of all the erasers is $4\\cdot e$ dollars. Thus, Mark spent $\\boxed{7p+4e}$ dollars in total.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the variables and relationships\nLet $p$ represent the cost of a pencil in dollars and $e$ represent the cost of an eraser in dollars. Given that Mark buys $3$ more pencils than erasers and he buys $7$ pencils, let $x$ represent the number of erasers Mark buys.\n\n## Step 2: Express the number of pencils in terms of the number of erasers\nThe number of pencils Mark buys is $7$, which is $3$ more than the number of erasers. Thus, $x + 3 = 7$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for the number of erasers\nSolve the equation from Step 2 for $x$: $x + 3 = 7 \\Rightarrow x = 7 - 3 \\Rightarrow x = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the cost of the erasers\nThe cost of $4$ erasers is $4e$ dollars.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the cost of the pencils\nSince Mark buys $7$ pencils and each pencil costs $p$ dollars, the cost of $7$ pencils is $7p$ dollars.\n\n## Step 6: Express",
