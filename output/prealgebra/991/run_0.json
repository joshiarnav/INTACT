    "solution": "We are asked to find the least common multiple of 360, 450 and 540.  We prime factorize \\begin{align*}\n360 &= 2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5 \\\\\n450 &= 2 \\cdot3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\\\\n540 &= 2^2\\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5\n\\end{align*} and take the largest exponent for each of the primes to get a least common multiple of $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2=\\boxed{5400}$.",
