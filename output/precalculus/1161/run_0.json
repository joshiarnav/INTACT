Let $p$ be the probability that the numbers $\\sin^2 x$, $\\cos^2 x$, and $\\sin x \\cos x$ are not the lengths of the sides of a triangle.

For such $x$, $$\\cos^2\nx\\ge\\sin x\\cos x\\ge\\sin^2 x,$$so the three numbers are not the lengths of the sides of a triangle if and only if $$\\cos^2\nx\\ge\\sin^2 x+ \\sin x \\cos x,$$which is equivalent to $\\cos\n2x\\ge{1\\over2}\\sin 2x$, or $\\tan 2x \\le2$. Because the tangent function is increasing in the interval $0^{\\circ}\\le\nx\\le45^{\\circ}$, this inequality is equivalent to $x\\le{1\\over2} \\arctan2$. It follows that $$p={{{1\\over2} \\arctan 2}\\over45^{\\circ}}={{\\arctan\n2}\\over90^{\\circ}},$$so $m + n = \\boxed{92}$.",
