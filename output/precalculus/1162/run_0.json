Multiplying both sides by $AC$ gives $BC = 2AB$.\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem gives us $AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2$.  Substituting $BC = 2AB$ gives \\[AB^2 + (2AB)^2 = AC^2.\\]Simplifying the left side gives $5AB^2 = AC^2$, so $\\frac{AB^2}{AC^2} = \\frac{1}{5}$, which means \\[\\cos A = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}}.\\]",
