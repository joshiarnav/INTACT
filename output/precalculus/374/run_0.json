    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "The plane $x = y$ cuts into two regions: one where $x < y$ and one where $x > y.$   We can make similar statements for the other two planar cuts.  Thus, which piece a point lies in depends only on the relative sizes of its coordinates.  For example, the points $(x,y,z)$ where $y < z < x$ represents one piece. Since there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ from smallest to largest, there are $\\boxed{6}$ pieces.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Visualize the cube and the planes\nThe cube of cheese is defined by the set $C = \\{(x,y,z) : 0 \\le x, y, z \\le 1\\}.$ This represents a cube with length, width, and height all equal to 1. The planes $x = y,$ $y = z,$ and $z = x$ cut through this cube.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the intersection points of the planes\nThe planes intersect at the points where $x = y = z.$ These points are $(0,0,0)$ and $(1,1,1).$\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of intersections between each pair of planes\nThe planes $x = y$ and $y = z$ intersect along the line defined by $x = y = z.$ They also intersect the edges of the cube, which are the lines $x = 0,$ $x = 1,$ $y = 0,$ $y = 1,$ $z = 0,$ and $z = 1.$\nThe plane $z = x$ intersects the edges of the cube along the lines $y = 0,$ $\n## Step 4: Calculate the intersections between the planes\nAll three planes intersect at the points $(0,0,0)$ and $(1,1,1)$ and each pair of planes intersects along the edges of the cube at three points: $(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, $(0,0,1)$, $(0,1,1)$, $(1,0,1)$, $(1,1,1)$.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of intersections between the planes\nThere are two triple intersection points at $(0,0,0)$ and $(1,1,1)$. Each pair of planes intersects at the edges of the cube, which gives 6 additional intersection points.\n\n## Step 6: Count the number of intersection surfaces\nEach pair of planes creates a surface of intersection. For example, the plane $x = y$ and the plane $y = z$ create a surface. There are three pairs of planes, so there are three surfaces of intersection.\n\n## Step 7: Count the number of regions\nAt each point of intersection, the three planes meet, creating a new region, or\n## Step 8: Find the total number of regions\nThere are 3 triple intersection points, 6 intersection points from the pairs of planes, and 3 planes creating the cube which also create 3 regions. So, there are $3+6+3=12$ points of intersection that create 6 additional regions. With the original 8 regions created by the cube, we have a total of $8+6=14$ regions. However, this is not the correct answer.\n\n## Step 9: Correct the total number of regions\nIn order to determine the correct number of regions, we need to consider each intersection surface separately. The intersection surface between $x=y$ and $y=z$ is the plane $x=z$, which creates one region. The intersection surface between $y=z$ and $z=x$ is the plane $y=x$, which creates one region. The intersection surface between $x=y$ and $z=x$ is the plane $x=y$, which creates one region. However, when we cut the cube along these planes, we also cut it along the edges, creating additional regions.\n\n## Step 10: Recalculate the number of regions\nThe intersection planes create 8 regions,\n## Step 11: The cube is divided into 8 smaller cubes by the planes and then each of these smaller cubes is further divided by the intersection surfaces. It seems that the regions in the cube can be considered as the regions in the smaller cubes plus the regions formed by the intersection surfaces. However, we should focus on how the planes and the intersection surfaces divide the cube into distinct regions, not into smaller cubes. When we cut the cube along the planes, we cut it into 8 octants, each representing a quarter of the cube. The planes cut each of these octants into two regions. Overall, when we cut the cube along the three planes, we cut it into 8 octants, each of which is cut into two regions by the planes, resulting in 16 regions in total. However, the intersection surfaces further divide these regions into distinct regions. Each plane intersects the other planes at the edges of the cube, creating additional regions. To count these regions correctly, we can consider that each plane divides the cube into two regions and then consider how these regions are further divided by the intersection surfaces. We can also visualize the regions and how they are divided by the planes and the intersection surfaces to arrive at the correct number of\n## Step 12: Count the number of regions in each octant\nEach octant, when cut by the three planes, will be divided into $2^3=8$ octants. But these octants are created by the planes cutting the octants into two regions and then intersecting with each other and the edges of the cube, creating additional regions.\n\n## Step 13: Count the number of regions in the entire cube\nSince there are $2^3=8$ octants in the cube, and each octant is divided into 8 regions, the entire cube is divided into $8 \\times 8 = 64$ regions.\n\n## Step 14: Subtract the regions created by the intersection surfaces\nHowever, this count includes the regions created by the intersection surfaces, which are counted more than once. To find the correct number of regions, we need to subtract these extra regions.\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the correct number of regions\nThe intersection surfaces create 12 regions, which have been counted more than once in the previous count.\n\n## Step 16: Subtract the extra regions\nWe subtract these extra regions from the previous count to get the correct number of regions.\n\n## Step 17: Final Answer",
