    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "Since\n\\[\\cos (\\sin (x + \\pi)) = \\cos (-\\sin(x)) = \\cos (\\sin(x)),\\]the function is periodic with period $\\pi.$\n\nFurthermore, $\\cos (\\sin x) = 1$ if and only $\\sin x = 0,$ which occurs only when $x$ is a multiple of $\\pi,$ so the period cannot be less than $\\pi.$  Therefore, the least period is $\\boxed{\\pi}.$",

This function has a period of $2\\pi$ when its input is $2\\pi$-periodic.\nStep 3: Since $\\sin(x)$ has a period of $2\\pi$, we need to find the smallest interval for which $\\cos(\\sin(x))$ repeats its values.\nStep 4: Since $\\sin(x)$ takes on values in the interval $[-1, 1]$ and repeats every $2\\pi$, the function $\\cos(\\sin(x))$ will repeat every interval that includes all possible values of $\\sin(x)$, which is the interval $[-1, 1]$. The length of this interval is $2$, so the least period of the function $\\cos(\\sin(x))$ is $2\\pi/2=\\pi$.\nStep 5: The least period of the function $\\cos(\\sin(x))$ is $\\pi$.\nStep 6: Therefore, the least period of the function $\\cos(\\sin(x))$ is $\\pi$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\pi$.",
