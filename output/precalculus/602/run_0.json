    "solution": "Once we realize to multiply the second equation by 4, the terms in the equations look very much like the expansion of $(x+y)^4$, with some negative signs appearing.  Closer inspection reveals that the two given equations are equivalent to the real and imaginary parts of a single statement involving complex numbers: \\[ (x+iy)^4 = 8 + 8i\\sqrt{3} = 16e^{\\pi i/3}. \\]In other words, we need only find the fourth root of $16e^{\\pi i/3}$ in the first quadrant, where $x$ and $y$ will both be positive.  Thus $x+iy=2e^{\\pi i/12}$; taking the real part yields our answer $x=2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right) = \\boxed{2\\cos 15^{\\circ}}$.",
