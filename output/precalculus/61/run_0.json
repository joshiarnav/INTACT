Additionally, the fact that the altitudes intersect on the incircle implies that the length of AD is equal to the length of AE.\nStep 4:  We can set angle BAD = angle BAE = \u03b8, and therefore, angle DAE = 180\u00b0 - 2\u03b8. Given that AD = AE, triangle ADE is isosceles, and we have AD = AE = r.\nStep 5:  In triangle ADE, the tangent of angle DAE is equal to the ratio of the adjacent side to the opposite side, which can be expressed as tan(180\u00b0 - 2\u03b8) = (r / r) * cot(2\u03b8).\nStep 6:  We know that cot(2\u03b8) = cot(180\u00b0 - 2\u03b8) = -cot(2\u03b8). Since tan(180\u00b0 - 2\u03b8) = -tan(2\u03b8), we have tan(2\u03b8) = -1.\nStep 7:  We know that the cosine of the vertex angle can be expressed in terms of the cosine of the base angles. Specifically, cos(A) = 1/2 * (cos(A/2) + cos(A/2)), where A is the vertex angle.\nStep 8:  We can use the double angle identity for cosine to express cos(2\u03b8) as 1 - 2sin\u00b2(\u03b8). Since tan(2\u03b8) = -1, we have sin(2\u03b8) = 1/\u221a2, and therefore sin(\u03b8) = 1/2.\nStep 9:  We know that sin(\u03b8) = 1/2. Using the Pythagorean identity sin\u00b2(\u03b8) + cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = 1, we can solve for cos(\u03b8).\nStep 10:  Given that sin(\u03b8) = 1/2, we have (1/2)\u00b2 + cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = 1, so cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = 3/4, and cos(\u03b8) = \u221a(3/4) = \u221a3/2.",
