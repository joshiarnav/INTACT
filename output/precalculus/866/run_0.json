By the Law of Cosines on triangle $PAB,$ \\[\n\\cos\\angle PAB=\\frac{3^2+(1+r)^2-(2+r)^2}{2\\cdot 3\\cdot(1+r)} =\n\\frac{3-r}{3(1+r)}.\n\\]Similarly, \\[\n\\cos\\angle PAC= \\frac{4^2+(1+r)^2-(3+r)^2}{2\\cdot 4\\cdot(1+r)} = \\frac{2-r}{2(1+r)}.\n\\]Since $\\angle PAB + \\angle PAC = 90^\\circ,$\n\\[\\cos^2 \\angle PAB  + \\cos^2 \\angle PAC = \\cos^2 \\angle PAB + \\sin^2 \\angle PAB = 1.\\]Hence,\n\\[\\left( \\frac{3 - r}{3(1 + r)} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{2 - r}{2(1 + r)} \\right)^2 = 1.\\]This simplifies to $23r^2 + 132r - 36 = 0,$ which factors as $(23r-6)(r+6) = 0$.  Therefore, $r=\\boxed{\\frac{6}{23}}.$",

This means that the lengths $OA=3$ and $AC=2+r$ are radii of two circles.\nStep 5: Because $OAC$ is a triangle, by the triangle inequality, $OA+AC>OC$ and $OC+OA>AC$. Substituting $OA=3$ and $AC=2+r$ into these inequalities, they become $3+2+r>OC$ and $OC+3>2+r$.\nStep 6:  Since the circles with radii 1 and 2 are externally tangent to the circle with radius $r$, the length $AC$ is equal to the sum of the radii of the circles with radii $r$ and 2.  So $AC=2+r$.\n $2+r>OC$ and $OC>2+r-3$.\nStep 7: $2+r>OC$ and $OC>2+r-3 \\Rightarrow 2+r>OC>2+r-3 \\Rightarrow 3>r-3 \\Rightarrow r<6.$\nStep 8:\nSince $OA=3$ and $OC>2+r-3$, we have that $OC>2+r-3 \\Rightarrow OC>2+r-3=2+r-3+1-1=3+r-1=2+r.$\nTherefore, $2+r>OC>2+r.$\nSince $r$ is the radius of the circle, $r>0$. Therefore, $2+r>2+r$.\nThis implies that $OC=2+r$, and $OC=OA+AC-2=3+2+r-2=3+r$.\nTherefore, $2+r=3+r \\Rightarrow 1=0.$\nStep 9: Since $OC=3+r$, we have $OC=OA+AC-2=3+2+r-2=5+r.$ Therefore, $5+r=3+r \\Rightarrow 2=0.$\nStep 10:\nSince $2+r>OC>2+r-3$, we have that $2+r>OC>2+r-3 \\Rightarrow 2+r>OC>2+r-3$. Since $OC=3+r$, we have that $2+r>3+r>2+r-3$. Therefore, we must have equality in the first inequality, so that $OA+AC=OC$, and $OA$ and $AC$ are radii.
