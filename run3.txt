For the right limit, we have $\lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 2^+} (
Step 5: The next step is to solve for $a$ by equating the right limit of $f(x)$ at $x=2$ to $-3$. 

$\lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 2^+} (ax + 3) = -3$

Now, substitute $x=2$ into the expression:

$2a + 3 = -3$

Next, we'll solve for $a$.
Step 6: To solve for $a$, we need to isolate it in the equation $2a + 3 = -3$. 

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

$2a + 3 - 3 = -3 - 3$

$2a = -6$

To isolate $a$, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

$2a/2 = -6/2$
Step 7: $a = -3$

Now, to find $b$, we need to ensure the piecewise function is continuous at $x=-2$. 

For $x = -2$:

- Right limit (from the right side): $\lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^+} (2x - b)$

To find the left limit (from the left side) of $f(x)$ at $x=-2
Step 8: The next step is to find the left limit of $f(x)$ at $x=-2$.

For $x=-2$:
- Left limit (from the left side): $\lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^-} (x-5) = -2-5 = -7$
Step 9: To ensure continuity, the right and left limits must be equal to f(-2). 

$\lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) = f(-2) = -7$

For the left limit, we have $\lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^-} (x-5) = -7$, which is already found to
Step 10: To find the expression for $f(x)$ at $x=-2$ based on the third part of the piecewise function, $f(x) = 2x-b$, because $-2$ is less than $-2$. 

$f(-2) = 2(-2) - b = -4 - b$
