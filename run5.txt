Since the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value at $x=2$ must be equal for the function to be continuous at $x=2$, we have that $-3 = 2a + 3$. Solving for $a$, we get: 

\[-3 = 2a + 3 \]
\[ -3 - 3 = 2a + 3 - 3 \]
\[-6 = 2a \]
\[-3 = a\]
To ensure that the function is continuous at $x=-2$, the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at $x=-2$ must be equal. The left-hand limit at $x=-2$ is the function value of $2x-b$ when $x$ approaches $-2$, so we have $\lim_{x \to -2^-} (2x-b) = -4-b$.

The right-hand limit at $x=-2$ is the function value of $x-5$ when $x$ approaches $-2$, so we have $\lim_{x \to -2^+} (x-5) = -2-5 = -7$.

The function value at $x=-2$ is $2x-b$ since $-2 \le x \le 2$, so we have $f(-2) = -4-b$.

Now, to ensure continuity at $x=-2$, we set the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value equal to each other and solve for $b$.
To ensure that the function is continuous at $x=-2$, the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at $x=-2$ must be equal. Since the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value at $x=-2$ must be equal for the function to be continuous at $x=-2$, we have that $-4-b = -7$. Solving for $b$, we get:

\[-4 - b = -7\]
\[-4 + 4 = -7 + 4\]
\[0 = -3\]
Since this equation is not true, we must find the error in our calculation. Let's revisit the setup of the right-hand limit at $x=-2$ and the function value at $x=-2$. The right-hand limit at $x=-2$ is the function value of $x-5$ when $x$ approaches $-2$, and the function value at $x=-2$ is $x-5$ since $-2 \le x \le 2$. So, we have that $\lim_{x \to -2^+} (x-5) = -7$ and $f(-
Since the right-hand limit at $x=-2$ is the function value of $x-5$ when $x$ approaches $-2$, and the function value at $x=-2$ is $x-5$ since $-2 \le x \le 2$, let's correct the function value of $x=-2$ to be $x-5$ instead of $2x-b$. We have that $\lim_{x \to -2^+} (x-5) = -7$ and $f(-2) = -2-5 = -7$.

Now, to ensure continuity at $x=-2$, we set the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value equal to each other and solve for $b$. Since the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value at $x=-2$ must be equal for the function to be continuous at $x=-2$, we have that $-4-b = -7$. Solving for $b$, we get:

\[-4 - b = -7\]
\[-4 + 4 = -7 + 4\]
\[0 = -3\]
This equation is still not true,
Since the last equation $0 = -3$ is not true, let's re-evaluate the function value at $x = -2$. We previously set the function value at $x = -2$ as $2x - b$ since $-2 \le x \le 2$, but this is incorrect. The correct function value at $x = -2$ should be $x - 5$ since $-2 \le x \le 2$. Now we have that $\lim_{x \to -2^-} (2x-b) = -4-b$ and $\lim_{x \to -2^+} (x-5) = -7$, and $f(-2) = -2-5 = -7$. Since the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value at $x=-2$ must be equal for the function to be continuous at $x=-2$, we have that $-4-b = -7$. Solving for $b$, we get: 

\[-4 -b = -7\]
\[-4 + 4 = -7 + 4\]
\[-b = -3\]
Now, let's multiply both
Now, let's multiply both sides of the equation $-b = -3$ by $-1$ to solve for $b$.

\[-b = -3\]
\[-1\cdot(-b) = -1\cdot(-3)\]
\[b = 3\]

Steps so far:
To solve for $a+b$, we first need to ensure that the function is continuous at $x=2$ and $x=-2$. For the function to be continuous at $x=2$, the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at $x=2$ must be equal. 

The left-hand limit at $x=2$ is the function value of $x-5$ when $x$ approaches $2$, so we have $\lim_{x \to 2^-} (x-5) = 2-5 = -3$.

The right-hand limit at $x=2$ is the function value of $ax+3$ when $x$ approaches $2$, so we have $\lim_{x \to 2^+} (ax+3) = 2a+3$.

The function value at $x=2$ is $ax+3$ since $x>2$, so we have $f(2) = 2a+3$.

Now, to ensure continuity at $x=2$, we set the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value equal to each other and solve for $a$.
Since the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value at $x=2$ must be equal for the function to be continuous at $x=2$, we have that $-3 = 2a + 3$. Solving for $a$, we get: 

\[-3 = 2a + 3 \]
\[ -3 - 3 = 2a + 3 - 3 \]
\[-6 = 2a \]
\[-3 = a\]
To ensure that the function is continuous at $x=-2$, the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at $x=-2$ must be equal. The left-hand limit at $x=-2$ is the function value of $2x-b$ when $x$ approaches $-2$, so we have $\lim_{x \to -2^-} (2x-b) = -4-b$.

The right-hand limit at $x=-2$ is the function value of $x-5$ when $x$ approaches $-2$, so we have $\lim_{x \to -2^+} (x-5) = -2-5 = -7$.

The function value at $x=-2$ is $2x-b$ since $-2 \le x \le 2$, so we have $f(-2) = -4-b$.

Now, to ensure continuity at $x=-2$, we set the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value equal to each other and solve for $b$.

Final answer reached.

Solution Steps:
Step 1: To solve for $a+b$, we first need to ensure that the function is continuous at $x=2$ and $x=-2$. For the function to be continuous at $x=2$, the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at $x=2$ must be equal. 

The left-hand limit at $x=2$ is the function value of $x-5$ when $x$ approaches $2$, so we have $\lim_{x \to 2^-} (x-5) = 2-5 = -3$.

The right-hand limit at $x=2$ is the function value of $ax+3$ when $x$ approaches $2$, so we have $\lim_{x \to 2^+} (ax+3) = 2a+3$.

The function value at $x=2$ is $ax+3$ since $x>2$, so we have $f(2) = 2a+3$.

Now, to ensure continuity at $x=2$, we set the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value equal to each other and solve for $a$.
Step 2: Since the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value at $x=2$ must be equal for the function to be continuous at $x=2$, we have that $-3 = 2a + 3$. Solving for $a$, we get: 

\[-3 = 2a + 3 \]
\[ -3 - 3 = 2a + 3 - 3 \]
\[-6 = 2a \]
\[-3 = a\]
Step 3: To ensure that the function is continuous at $x=-2$, the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at $x=-2$ must be equal. The left-hand limit at $x=-2$ is the function value of $2x-b$ when $x$ approaches $-2$, so we have $\lim_{x \to -2^-} (2x-b) = -4-b$.

The right-hand limit at $x=-2$ is the function value of $x-5$ when $x$ approaches $-2$, so we have $\lim_{x \to -2^+} (x-5) = -2-5 = -7$.

The function value at $x=-2$ is $2x-b$ since $-2 \le x \le 2$, so we have $f(-2) = -4-b$.

Now, to ensure continuity at $x=-2$, we set the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value equal to each other and solve for $b$.
Step 4: To ensure that the function is continuous at $x=-2$, the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at $x=-2$ must be equal. Since the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value at $x=-2$ must be equal for the function to be continuous at $x=-2$, we have that $-4-b = -7$. Solving for $b$, we get:

\[-4 - b = -7\]
\[-4 + 4 = -7 + 4\]
\[0 = -3\]
Since this equation is not true, we must find the error in our calculation. Let's revisit the setup of the right-hand limit at $x=-2$ and the function value at $x=-2$. The right-hand limit at $x=-2$ is the function value of $x-5$ when $x$ approaches $-2$, and the function value at $x=-2$ is $x-5$ since $-2 \le x \le 2$. So, we have that $\lim_{x \to -2^+} (x-5) = -7$ and $f(-
Step 5: Since the right-hand limit at $x=-2$ is the function value of $x-5$ when $x$ approaches $-2$, and the function value at $x=-2$ is $x-5$ since $-2 \le x \le 2$, let's correct the function value of $x=-2$ to be $x-5$ instead of $2x-b$. We have that $\lim_{x \to -2^+} (x-5) = -7$ and $f(-2) = -2-5 = -7$.

Now, to ensure continuity at $x=-2$, we set the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value equal to each other and solve for $b$. Since the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value at $x=-2$ must be equal for the function to be continuous at $x=-2$, we have that $-4-b = -7$. Solving for $b$, we get:

\[-4 - b = -7\]
\[-4 + 4 = -7 + 4\]
\[0 = -3\]
This equation is still not true,
Step 6: Since the last equation $0 = -3$ is not true, let's re-evaluate the function value at $x = -2$. We previously set the function value at $x = -2$ as $2x - b$ since $-2 \le x \le 2$, but this is incorrect. The correct function value at $x = -2$ should be $x - 5$ since $-2 \le x \le 2$. Now we have that $\lim_{x \to -2^-} (2x-b) = -4-b$ and $\lim_{x \to -2^+} (x-5) = -7$, and $f(-2) = -2-5 = -7$. Since the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value at $x=-2$ must be equal for the function to be continuous at $x=-2$, we have that $-4-b = -7$. Solving for $b$, we get: 

\[-4 -b = -7\]
\[-4 + 4 = -7 + 4\]
\[-b = -3\]
Now, let's multiply both
Step 7: Now, let's multiply both sides of the equation $-b = -3$ by $-1$ to solve for $b$.

\[-b = -3\]
\[-1\cdot(-b) = -1\cdot(-3)\]
\[b = 3\]
Step 8: Now that we have the value of $a$ and $b$, we can find their sum. We have that $a = -3$ and $b = 3$. To find the sum of $a$ and $b$, we simply add them together:

$a + b = -3 + 3$
Step 9: The next step is to calculate the sum of $a$ and $b$:

$a + b = -3 + 3$

Final Answer: The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
